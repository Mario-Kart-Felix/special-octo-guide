What is your target $$$ and your target date?Mine&#039;s hitting $1MM in 2031 (age 40).Just wanna beat the starving artist stereotype by earning the millionaire title (currently get paid $45 an hour, but only working 10-15 hours a week).
No clue if a MM is a M or a B, but I want to hit 1M by next year. Currently got $100 on Augur
&gt;&gt;2356979Is a M. I absolutely want to hit a B too, but it doesn&#039;t feel possible.A 10 000x increase is a steep bet. Any other plans?

Age: 24Net worth: EUR ~1600000How: At 19 created an online marketplace still up in and running (sold shares 2 years ago), then invested a little in cryptos back in early 2016 while creating a new company (tech) just starting up.My parents are both working middle class jobs, I always dreamed to be a millionaire, I am on my way to have 2M by 2018, if my new venture works I can maybe reach a B in 7 years. I find having money not very rewarding when it is earned by pure speculation. I had so much pride creating jobs, starting a business from scratch to sell it for few hundred thousands. More than making over a million in cryptos.I bought a house where my mom lives now, that was nice.Spoiler : We are going to release one of the most promising token in a year.
&gt;&gt;2357176Details?
&gt;&gt;2357176wow, that&#039;s insane! when you say online marketplace, do you mean on tor for illegal drugs or what are we talking about lol...also, u got a girlfriend?

These XEM bags are getting pretty heavy guys
Should have bought some litedoge instead retard
you talking about XEM? The coin that&#039;s lost 50% of its value since I bought it? Nope. Not bothering me at all.
wagerr ICO right nowlast chance to get in below 10 centsHOT HOT HOT
I&#039;m still up by about $300 from my initial XEM purchase so I&#039;m just going to hold. XEM is the sleeping giant.
Yeah, just hold. They will release Catapult in august which will bump it up quite a bit.
They did not win a fucking PEER AWARD!It was a voting among the contestants, not a actual award!So could we please stop beeing retarded and start again with the serious news? Like... is there a new coin to shill on jewbit?
&gt;&gt;2358466Exactly lol. The real awards will be announced in July.
who cares about the fucking awards, honestly?
&gt;&gt;2358506Enough people to actually create 2 to 3 threads per minute either shilling the coin to heaven or damn it to hell, just because the CEO of digibyte looked like a toddler in front of a presentation, made by a freshman of a third-class university in north korea in 1998.
&gt;&gt;2358506This.
&gt;&gt;2358466no, the peer award was part of the event. they didn&#039;t win the peer award AND they didn&#039;t win the real award.
https://twitter.com/dgb_ycagel/status/873177840547528705&gt;Jared: We have made several great connections with several people at Citi, MasterCard, PwC and MSFT. As well as some government authorities.Yeah... this thing is going to be the next Ethereum
&gt;&gt;2358577the real award will be announce in July only.yesterday was just a crappy popular vote award
There are 3 awards awarded that the end of the competition. The first is by citi themselves. The peer award is what I think is the third or maybe second. Yeah peer is second and audience us third.It would be more accurate to say they didnt even win a peer award or audience award.If anyone is winning actual awards it&#039;s going up be the three from each section that had enough good reception to win before.Why would they win an actual award when they weren&#039;t even good enough to win this?
&gt;&gt;2358584&gt;https://twitter.com/dgb_ycagel/status/873177840547528705If you don&#039;t buy now you cannot be helped
&gt;&gt;2358602what if a team is only allowed to win one award?
&gt;&gt;2358584Is digibyte-ycagel an official part of DGB?
&gt;&gt;2358632no but jared is
&gt;&gt;2358602thats stupid thinking. so they should just give the grand prize to the one who won the peer award yesterday if i follow your &#039;logic&#039;
&gt;&gt;2358466DGB is doomed. Hold the bags like a man and lose all your money.I got out on time, took my loss!! Happy I did.
&gt;&gt;2358602going to these contests aren&#039;t all about winnings you idiot.if that&#039;s the way any company worked then there would be no worthy companyto invest into.it&#039;s all about showing yourself and putting yourself out there and then making connections with the large companies that are out there alreadyTHATS HOW BUSINESS IS DONEnot &quot;here&#039;s an award you&#039;re now you&#039;re now a 100 billion $ company cause we handed you this piece of trophy&quot;
&gt;&gt;2358678buy high sell low
&gt;&gt;2358679This!And Laravel news, somehow nobody is talking about it here
&gt;&gt;2358679&gt;it&#039;s all about showing yourself and putting yourself out there and then making connections with the large companies that are out there alreadyyeah you do that with a shitty powerpoint slide show that looks like it was made by a 10 year old.
&gt;&gt;2358534Go to his actual Twitter account and stop using /biz/ threads to get your information, he had more than one slide and the other 2 pictures that he posted were obviously not with white background.Seriously, just sell now and remain a peasant
&gt;&gt;2358466Why is everyone talking about the fucking award? I dont even know there will be an award. Its about getting popular, right?Fuck it. Im still in plus. I will hold. Panic selling was never a good idea.
&gt;&gt;2358791I am not using /biz/ for information, I am here because of having fun. But the groundless FUD against DGB is on a new level.
in ~6 hours there&#039;s going to be so much profit to be made here, you&#039;d be stupid to not buy this dip
&gt;&gt;2358854because...
&gt;&gt;2358890The real event hasn&#039;t happened
LOL. rip in pepperoniBuy SIA coin you fucking baka
&gt;&gt;2358364you&#039;re retarded if you&#039;re not buying DGB right now&gt;Buy SIA coinah the /biz/ way, buy high sell low
&gt;&gt;2358377this
If you aren&#039;t hodling both you hate money
&gt;&gt;2358364Sorry to break it to you, but SC always follows DGB. We&#039;re in this shit together, anon. That&#039;s why I&#039;m holding both.
&gt;&gt;2358364If you&#039;re not buying this dip right now you&#039;re retarded.
&gt;&gt;2358364BLOOD ON THE STREETSTIME TO BUY BUY BUYBUYBUY BUY BUYBUY
&gt;&gt;2358389yep, just looking at the buys, there&#039;s a 15 BTC buy on 0.00001868, this is literally the bottom, only up from here
&gt;&gt;2358388I&#039;m too am in the DGB/SC broship
Oh wow lookIt&#039;s exactly what I told you fuckers yesterday10% increase and that&#039;s itWowIt&#039;s fucking nothing
Seriously though Sia Is a great fucking hold. I&#039;d wait until the next dip to buy in though.
&gt;&gt;2358364hahahha down 500 sats todayVery nice coin
Looks like it&#039;s preparing to take a nose dive today.
&gt;&gt;2358395&gt;&gt;2358399&gt;&gt;2358389&gt;&gt;2358377i hope yall are right. I just bought at 1876 and at 1868, and im not a rich guy so i need this to kinda work out biz
&gt;&gt;2358425why are people on /biz/ so bad at reading charts? THIS IS THE BOTTOM, IT CAN ONLY GO UP FROM HERE
1800 is the lowest it can go
&gt;&gt;2358431Cut your losses and buy ETH
&gt;&gt;2358364ouch
&gt;&gt;2358402Hahaha literally me. Im half and half and let me tell you, holding SIA was heavy for days and then it shot up 15%. Dgb will be the same way. I wont sell at a loss because im not an impatient retard
&gt;hurr its down today after all time highThis is why you&#039;re poor, fucking hold or buy more you inbreds

&gt;&gt;2351464yeah. all the existing DGB neets have dried up their piggy banks. i don&#039;t think the additional 20 people that see this announcement are going to save the daytheir only saving grace is going to be if a whale comes in and buys the price up. but they are retarded if they think the whale is going to let them dump out from underneath him haha.
&gt;still above 2k satsmost of us are doing just fine
Top kek, just jumped 100 sats back up, weak hands are just sucking whales cocks. Not too late to buy back in lads ;)
&gt;&gt;2351457See you in LamboLand Lads
&gt;tfw you sell for 2150 to buy more in the dip but the price raises and to not loose the train, paid 2205 ... looses 1k dgb
There&#039;s been so much FUD for this coin, but I&#039;m pretty /comfy/ hodling since 110 sat.People will FUD this coin at 50 cents, people will FUD it at $1.
&gt;&gt;2351457DGB $10 by year&#039;s end.
&gt;&gt;2351627Same, hodling since 115 and 149 sat.Always resisted the temptation knowing I will curse myself next month

&gt;&gt;2351627&gt;&gt;2351652Very nice. In since 118 here, but I bought more around 350 and 500 sats too.I see no reason to let go of these any sooner than one year from now. Watching it hit the top 15 on CoinMarketCap was exciting, but I&#039;m waiting for it to hit the Top 5.

&gt;&gt;2351483It had been fluctuating repeatedly between 1700-2000 for several days, so you had day traders constantly buying and selling to enjoy the minor gains that way.Likely what happened is many were watching for today when the price would go up and then set orders to sell if it dropped to 2100-2200 again. So as soon as it dipped slightly it caused a rush of those auto-sales to be set off. And even as typing the price is increasing back to 2200 so the effect seems to have worn off somewhat.This is probably a consequence of DGB having enjoyed a high at nearly reaching 3000 so some people were expecting any dipping to be a sign that it was crashing.

&gt;&gt;2352421We&#039;re all risking our money here, why the fuck do beggars think they deserve a free ride? If they can afford a phone or computer to post on 4chan in the first place it means they aren&#039;t in such poverty that they can&#039;t deposit a few bucks to gamble with their own money.

this shitcoin on cryptopia has paper thin sell walls and with only $4mill market capwhales have been accumulating yesterday and today and it just got listed on cryptopia 2 days agohttps://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange?market=1337_BTC#he missed DGBhe missed SIAhe missed ETHhe missed ARKhe missed BITB&gt;will he miss 1337?
forget about the girls, 1337 gamers&gt;acquire coin
fucking burger scum are always sleeping
nope im out
&gt;&gt;2358068&gt;no-coiner&gt;getting out
&gt;&gt;2357990Seems pretty decent, in fact. And Cryptopia is way better than YoBit.Haven&#039;t bought yet, but I&#039;ll keep an eye on it.
Okay, bought a bit with DOGE
&gt;&gt;2358350&gt;HODLgood stuff anon, i&#039;ll see you on the moon in a week
Hey /biz/ I&#039;ve been here for quite some time and managed to turn my inital investment in huge profit.So I decided to setup 1-3 mining rig(s) at home.I have checked every website in the country, they say new shipment of 480s will be available within 3 weeks.Do I wait 3 weeks or go and buy 580s?What&#039;s the hash rate of them both?Is mining profitable in long term?Electricity here is dirt cheap.
shameless self bump
&gt;&gt;2357597Yes long term it is. Make sure you have enough circuits in your house, because each miner probably needs a different circuit to mine on if you have 6 cards per machine. Also rx 580s are the same as rx 480s except they are not as efficient. You can undervolt them and change the memory timings to make them pretty similar to the rx 480.

What will be the next coin to repeat DGB and RDD&#039;s success and go up 20x in one month?
If I had that kind of crystal ball I&#039;d sell this kind of prophecy for $100,000 each.
RDD is still not finished, it just takes a little break in the space station atm :)
https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/iconomi/#chartsit&#039;s already started
&gt;&gt;2358907Is it going to go up 20x again though?
verge
Why you should buy RDD:http://imgur.com/a/w5Kzq
Redd ID is coming soon.Get the fuck off DGB, it&#039;s a sinking ship
&gt;&gt;2357450So fucking stoked, no redders on suicide watch,
Buying under 500sats is massive savings
yeah, I agree it is still undervalued compared to other altcoins ($0.0028). You can see from the chart, it has a healthy growth over time. It is not a PnD altcoin. It has a real functionality especially in the social media.
Can you give me a prediction on this one?how long until it&#039;s 1k/10k/1$?
If the Redd-ID comes out (and it will soon, very soon), it could reach 300-500 satoshi IMO
Well it started as a PnD coin about a month ago but the fresh capital really made a change and got the devs off their asses. It will rise even more once Redd ID is launched in the coming days.
&gt;&gt;2357713&gt;I feel like it&#039;ll hit 1K~2K as soon as Redd ID comes out.10k once we have a userbase around Redd ID which won&#039;t be hard. Probably next year
&gt;&gt;23577131 Week / 1 Month / 1 YearGuaranteed
&gt;&gt;2357767that&#039;s a bit fast but nothing wrong. lets hope it hits those numbers
Redd-ID is almost done. The developers just wait for the situation to &quot;calm down&quot;. John Nash (the lead dev) said that he personally does not like PnD scheme. He said in the interview that Redd-ID is 95% finished.Link to the interview:https://youtu.be/aEJTNZ6FCPc?t=24m33s
&gt;&gt;2357713&gt;http://imgur.com/a/w5Kzqstop deluding yourself. I am balls deep in this coin but 400 sats is a much more reasonable figure.
When do you guys think Redd-ID will come out?
&gt;&gt;2357825This weekend bro.Someone had source
ok, i just noticed that it&#039;s doing basically the same movement as some time ago what the fuck. therefore it &quot;SHOULD&quot; moon soon.
Nobody knows for sure except the devs. But from what John said that it is 95% finished, it could be anytime soon (weeks). However, when that time comes, it will jump really fast to higher values. Therefore, currently it is a great time to buy RDD IMO
&gt;&gt;2357844It&#039;s not coming out this weekend wtfProbably next monthGet it while its cheap
&gt;&gt;2357844Thanks senpai
Those fucking sell walls are holding this coin down so bad
i put in 1btc at teh bottom just for shtis n gigs
In at 100 sats, take me to the moon sometime soon plz
&gt;&gt;2357883Nah, whales are accumulatingAnother pump incoming I thinkLook at the chart patterns
When Redd-ID is launched, this RDD will break 1,000 sats overnight.Depending on how rapidly it is adopted it will break 10k sats within months/weeks of Redd-ID launch.Normies can use it, grandma can use it, camgirls can use it.It&#039;s the cryptocoin to bring crypto into mainstream social media, and will open the nocoiner market to crypto as a whole since it will stop being some technological mystery currency and employ low-barrker usage for social media microtipping.It isn&#039;t trying to compete with eth/btc, and never will. It&#039;ll ride to maybe $0.05-0.15 USD, maybe peaking around $0.50-1.00.But that&#039;s ~20-400x the current value of $0.0028Not an overnight moon or daytrading coin, get in now while it&#039;s 100 sat and hold for 6mo so you can retire in lamboland
&gt;&gt;2357883you fucking idiot. look at the buy orders for this, and then fucking slap yourself.you should be thanking your lord kek in heaven that the price is being held down right now so for once in your life you have a chance to just buy and hodl and not be a fucking bagholder faggot
Do you think it will rise soon? I&#039;m having a hard time deciding between this and Waves, and yes, I have to decide because I&#039;m already holding 5 coins I don&#039;t want to let go.
Why is this coin being shilled so hard? Is anon looking out for us or just trying to dump his bags on someone?
&gt;&gt;2358417it&#039;s not being shilled...lots of shitcoins are being shilled right now and the people not holding bags are trying to remind you fucktards what a real investment looks like
&gt;&gt;2358417Well shilling isn&#039;t always a bad thing. Look at Ark for example, shit is being shilled insanely here but that didn&#039;t stop from having a 100% increase in price in the spam of a few days.Anon probably has a bag of Reddcoins, but if his intention was to dump quickly, I don&#039;t think he would post about it for such a long time.
Okay fuck it, bought some of this. When can I expect some returns? seems like shit&#039;s steady at 100 sat mark
RDD always pumps on Fridays get in now
&gt;&gt;2358417IMO, this coin is a long-term investment, if you are interested to learn about RDD, you can visit:https://www.reddcoin.com/https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoinhttps://www.reddcointalk.org/I have bought this coin since it is only several satoshi and will hold it for a long time. :)
&gt;&gt;2358525What&#039;s your honest opinion about&gt;&gt;2358347?I want to invest on this, but think that Waves is on a bigger upward trend atm. Do you disagree?
&gt;&gt;2358546Waves has increased a lot for the last several months until it reaches $596 M market cap. It is a good coin with good technology. However, if you see RDD market cap which is still around $84 M (relatively low). It has more potential to growth to higher level since RDD has several unique functionality (especially in social media)
&gt;&gt;2358546I can only give recommendations, we don&#039;t know where the market is heading to (too many uncertainties in the equation), we can only see the fundamental technology behind the coins :)
&gt;&gt;2358633I know, maybe I&#039;m just asking a question that&#039;s pretty much impossible to answer with certainty.It&#039;s hard to make compromises though. My plan was to put money into Waves now(Recent news lead me to believe that it will go up this weekend), then sell and use the gains to invest on RDD. But we never know what will happen, maybe RDD moons this weekend and I kill myself.
Lost a lot with scam-coins on YoBit, put all of my remaining money in RDD. SAVE ME RDD
&gt;&gt;2358611How will it be implemented though? Thanks for giving a clear answer above btw, and not shilling crap about moon etc. I have 0.5btc to spare atm
&gt;&gt;2358671maybe you should diversify instead then, it will reduce the risk :), I suggest to RDD, at least a little bit.
RDD IS SOON ROCKETING LOOK AT BIDS
let&#039;s rock, injected 1btc.
&gt;&gt;2358734You mean the RDD technology?you can find the answer here:General info about RDD:https://www.reddcoin.com/Twitter Tip:https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/wiki/tipbot_twitter#wiki_4._withdrawProof of Stake Velocity (PoSV):https://www.reddcoin.com/papers/PoSV_FAQ.pdfRedd-ID:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsRBTROQnOwLatest update (Interview with John Nash (the lead dev):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEJTNZ6FCPcIf you have any other questions you can ask in RDD reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/There are several devs there that can answer your questions :)
&gt;&gt;2358546Spread your investment, I&#039;m invested in both
now digibyte is gone, we buy ARKCome on EU rocketscientist monies
The sell walls are paperthin. There is just 1 BTC until 50 sats. It&#039;s at 9 sats now. Only 0.001 left on 9 sats, get in before 15 and go to lamboland!
&gt;&gt;2358669Fuck 9 sat just went, got in at 10 sats though, this is gonna be like STARS I hope
&gt;&gt;2358689just look at these fucking sell walls, they&#039;re paperthin. someone can pump this shit to heaven. LETS DO IT BIZ!
&gt;&gt;2358689I fucking told you we were crushing these walls. At 16 sat already!
&gt;No active marketsWhere the fuck do u even found these shitty coins
&gt;&gt;2358801WE IN THIS, JOIN WHILE YOU STILL CAN !
&gt;&gt;2358830Tiny dip, new guys can join in and we&#039;re going back to 40 sats!
&gt;&gt;2358669S A G E
Hold or sell?
&gt;&gt;2358841Dunno, but I recommend looking into 1337 coin
&gt;&gt;2358841More people selling than buying. It&#039;s over
Yes I am back again with an update.Who told you guys to buy $XVG at 5 sats?Who told you guys to buy $RDD around 14/15 sats?Who told you guys to buy $PPC?Who told you guys to buy $LMC?Who told you guys to buy $STEEM last week?Now, in this game you need to have patience.I am still adding to my $LMC position. Maybe some of you are upset but that&#039;s part of the game. If you have patience it will pay off. If you can&#039;t stand the heat, then get out the kitchen and find another source of income.Anyway, I am here to tell you, to the braves ones who bought $STEEM to take off at least 50% now.I have bought $XVC this morning and as I already mentioned, added to my $LMC.Good luck out there and remember, patience is key!
It&#039;s not too late to buy RDD.Once Redd ID comes out we&#039;ll see 2KHold for long term boys
&gt;&gt;2356877&gt;Remember me guys?Literally fucking who?
&gt;&gt;2356877Ballparking, what kind of roi are you expecting from lmc?
&gt;&gt;2356877&gt;Who told you guys to buy $LMC?You, and it was a bad callAlso just use a tripcode dude...
&gt;&gt;2356939A whale
&gt;&gt;2356877Ok sir. But should we dump STRAT or no?
&gt;&gt;2356972&gt;&gt;&gt;/LGBT/And tumblr are that way. Return to your own kind
&gt;&gt;2356877&gt;patience is key!Yeah, you&#039;ll eventually be right in a bull market.RDD was a P&amp;D at the start, so was XVG. Don&#039;t pretend that it wasn&#039;t at the beginning you LARPer.You want to act like a tripfag? Get a goddamn trip so I know it&#039;s the same faggot and I might just listen enough to laugh when your predictions come up empty.
&gt;&gt;2357972XVG is holding up pretty good for a pnd
&gt;&gt;2357972RDD is actually steady at 100 sat faggot
&gt;&gt;2356877Oh look another loser who thought he&#039;s pro for getting 2 out of 198 coins correctly.If you can&#039;t manage to land at least 20 coins and can&#039;t manage to become at the very least a millionaire then you&#039;re not cut out for trading.This bull market is your only chance to become a millionaire, don&#039;t blow it.Obviously because everyone on /biz/ is a talentless hacks you&#039;re all going to start blowing on your knees for pennies.
&gt;&gt;2356877Hello Attila. Which of your positions are the most promising in your opinion? And why? I like LMC but I&#039;m a wage slave and I&#039;m afraid of missing the pump if it&#039;s a p&amp;d
Oh sheit, oh sheeeeit.Verge (XVG) is about to moon towards 200 and beyond.GET ON THE VERGETRAIN OR DIE POOR
&#039;sure&#039;
I jumped off while the price got even that high. Should&#039;ve sold at ~230+ sats while I had the chance.Babby&#039;s first coin still ended up turning a little profit. How about you?
Verge is already dead coin. Just look a charts.
J U S T
&gt;poloniex is a scam!&gt;can&#039;t register on bittrex without entering details!&gt;coinbase won&#039;t let me enter a card!So, why isn&#039;t /biz/ talking about BitShares?&gt;established project&gt;working decentralized exchange&gt;1-5 seconds transactions&gt;already processes more transactions per day than BitcoinBitShares has two problems: lack of marketing, and an intimidating interface for newbies. Those problems aren&#039;t fundamental issues. With talks of a Bitcoin fork in August and centralized exchanges unable to handle the newcomers, people are bound to become educated and look towards BitShares.The easiest use of cryptocurrencies is as a currency (duh). Once people see Bitcoin&#039;s fees and wait for hours to get a transaction confirmed, some of them are bound to look up fast transactions and low fees. BitShares is fast, cheap, and has the volume to prove it can handle the load.You can already see this in play. BTS pumped +30% for 2 days straight. At 7400 sat it&#039;s still way undervalued. You could hold on for a bit and hope for a dip, it&#039;s worth keeping an eye on.Think this is a PnD? Just zoom out the graph. Nothing but a steady uptrend since March. They missed their launch a few years back, it was too early for their value proposition to mean something to the market. Now that network congestion is messing with the big players, there&#039;s an important niche to be filled.&gt;why BitShares and not Waves?Why not both? Waves is a good project too, and you should invest long-term in both. Waves was smarter with their marketing and more accessible, and you can see the result. Both of these coins should keep going up.
Just a reminder to all you fags that said:&quot;XBY is a scam&quot;&quot;XBY will dump on your ass&quot;&quot;XBY is just a way for original ICO members to get money back&quot;AHAHAHAAHHAHHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAWe are currently level and stable, and various separate TA youtubers are starting to predict drastic price rises soon.We arent even on Bittrex or Poloniex yet, that comes when nodes get activated.Instant $0.02 to $0.10 minimum at that point, if we&#039;re not already there before... Thats 5X your investment minimum!!!$1 is the aim for 2018 that would be 50X your investment at todays rates, and from there... Who knows!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edm2X_q_nPIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwvwrya3O1khttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsyf4zyMu_ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfdT2pTTR_I
&gt;&gt;2358553I guess everyone too busy sucking DGB dick to get their pennies back
Started with $50 last week. Very new to this. Rate my bags
&gt;&gt;2358686in a word? patheticno xvgno rddno sc
&gt;&gt;2358686Also, if someone could give me some advice to get to the four figure mark asap, that would be amazing
&gt;&gt;2358726I love you too
&gt;&gt;2358752the advice has been given fren
Don&#039;t listen to these retarded comments lmfaoBiz is actually retarded
&gt;&gt;2358686good workit&#039;s not a $88.27 gain, it&#039;s a 276.54% gainthis kind of growth is exponential&gt;2&gt;4&gt;8&gt;16&gt;32&gt;64&gt;128&gt;256&gt;512&gt;1024&gt;2048&gt;4096&gt;etc.
&gt;&gt;2358856Thank you very much, sir! Do you think my wallet looks okay? And do you have any advice for a newbie like me? Still learning the ropes
Its hyper competitive, and I am tired of shitting money away on SEO, etc.If you ever were a customer of boner pills... what is it that got you to buy online?Is it strictly price?We do differentiate ourselves from the competition - our pills are not from China or India, they a 100% full strength and we mention this throughout our site.Bonus Question:Is bitcoin a good idea? What I dont get is.. wouldnt I need to ship to an address.. so that whole &quot;secret transaction&quot;.. is kinda bullshit, right?
&gt;&gt;2357311taking pills is so wierd man... fucking hell.I would open up the company marketing-wise. Do it like &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;, and &quot;aphrodisiac&quot;, and &quot;you 2 can experiment&quot; and stuff... everybody is in kinky stuff, but nobody is into flat dicks!!!!Would convert to tea or herb, not pills too. Pills are not sexy. Sexy tea is sexy.hey, this is real advice for once
&gt;&gt;2357390I understand what you mean.. but this isnt &quot;horny goat weed&quot; type stuff. I am offering legit viagra, Cialis, etc. I could literally offer anything from a pharma.. but I stuck with boner pills, but its been hard to convert lookers into actual buyers.Thanks for the suggestion - we might muddle into OEM vitamins type stuff.
Accept payments in Ethereum.
&gt;&gt;2357429If that&#039;s the case, then go full blown official. Gov. control here, quality badges there. Offer anonymous package sending (very important). Quality control. Offer refunds if quality is not good enough. Contact and phone numbers EVERYWHERE! Act like you are the 1. national drugstore, and the only one they can trust. I know trust and price are the key issues in buying pills over the net (have read that some years ago)
nigga you need a good COPYWRITER to sell that shit. high chance your copy sucks balls and fucks up your conversions.sauce: im a pro copywriter but dont mess with penis pills so dont even bother me about it
&gt;&gt;2357311I&#039;ve looked into buying some before but the sites wanted prescriptions and shiz, was too much effort.
Yes of course you should accept bitcoin, and no don&#039;t let the address bother you, there&#039;s people who literally buy cocaine on the deepweb and have it shipped to their address, as long as you advertise that you have discreet shipping.And i&#039;ve never bought boner pills, but if I were you i&#039;d go on Youtube right now, search every single male self help alpha improvement channel, and find one with a low amount of subscribers and have try and set up a sponsorship for a video.That&#039;s just my ideas.Anyway OP, where do you get your supply from? Is there a website or did you contact suppliers locally, or are you buying from alibaba or what? Genuinely interested, either way good luck.
&gt;&gt;2357429What darknet market you sell on?
&gt;&gt;2357311see at syscoin, but not invest to mach
Ill work on the copy.We have a pretty funny Blog, and dont take ourselves very serious.. maybe this is a bad thing.. but compared to everyone else who just regurgitates the latest ED Pill finding ( we do that too.) we throw in dick jokes all the time, and funny pics.. on the blog part of our site.
&gt;&gt;2357530I would love to get on darknet... Right now.. again.. it seems like everyone is a scammer there so we distances ourselves from it.
&gt;&gt;2357536this just confirms you dont have the slightest clue about copywriting (aka SALESMANSHIP in print)hint: its not about making dick jokes or funny pictures. its about getting people to open their wallet and hand over their money to you.seriously do yourself a favour and hire a good copywriter.
&gt;&gt;2357522&gt;Anyway OP, where do you get your supply from? Is there a website or did you contact suppliers locally, or are you buying from alibaba or what? Genuinely interested, either way good luck.Uncle is in pharma... and outside of the USA. South America.
r/sst if you&#039;re willing to stock a few more products and will accept bitcoin
&gt;&gt;2357561the dick jokes, etc.. are not on the main site.. as per selling pages.. its a seperate section.. that just feeds off the typical google posts about ED news.. and inbetween are dick jokes.I am not telling dick jokes on the same page they are buying / shopping.
&gt;&gt;2357574&gt;r/sstHOLY FUCKING SHIT, THANKS ANNON!!!!
If you hold the supplies yourself then start an affiliate program and let other people sell it for you
&gt;&gt;2357768lot of the major AP out there are not so cool with meds.
Also if you want to get a little more blackhat look into giving out &quot;free samples&quot; of your pills for $5 or so then rebill them $200 two weeks later, thats what a lot of other online pill companies are doing
&gt;&gt;2357806We know that trick.. but we like to be honest with our customers and not screw them over. We offer great products, and ship fast. Its way easier to gain 1 customer, than to have 50 who think you are dog shit and spread like the wind that you are dogshit on the internet.
&gt;&gt;2357800There&#039;s lots of affiliate networks that host diet pill offers and shit like that I&#039;m pretty sure you can find one that will accept your shitty boner pills
&gt;&gt;2357311LOL this is a welcome variation to the coinshills. Kamagra is sold at about 5$ for 4 online reliably.Thing is if you can get anything pharma.. people don&#039;t trust &quot;boner pill sites&quot; they&#039;re 99999k scams out there. If you sold more than that and started one of many many many online pharmacies (your competition is rich and well supplied) you might actually sell some of those boner pills too.If your supply line is quick consider putting em on and just ordering when somebody orders it off of you or sth.
&gt;&gt;2357829Well I guess if you&#039;re trying to establish a long term brand then sure but with something like boner pills the people buying it already expect to get scammedThe other anon above me is right too good luck competing with actual pharma companies if you want to be &quot;fully legit&quot;
&gt;&gt;2357829I&#039;m a 25 years old male who had constant streaks of ED (erectile dysfunction) due to severe anxiety, and always refrained from buying &quot;boner pills&quot;. Why?Almost every dick pill website will boast about how awesome their pills are and that I should trust their stock photo scientist. Well, I didn&#039;t care about that.What I wanted was someone who cared about my situation (I was devastated) and was also very discrete about it (I was also very ashamed).So, OP, what you need to do is the following:- Ditch the dick jokes, you&#039;re handling a serious matter. Yes, I know they&#039;re only on your blog but still, you could upset your potential clients with your lack of finesse.- Don&#039;t boast about how efficient your pills are. Instead, promise your clients how bonerpill will help them overcome anxiety and be always ready for action.- Reduce risk. Almost everyone (me included) is afraid that these pills are a scam and/or will damage my health. Offer refunds, post your company address and phone, have testimonials in your website, grab some &quot;Government Approved&quot; stamps, offer discretion and anonymity.Again, OP, no one wants to buy boner pills. They want to buy relief, support and understanding. Be sure to make that reflect on your website copy and I&#039;m sure your conversion rates will increase.
&gt;&gt;2357311collect all emails from public dumps and spam it to death
&gt;&gt;2358052good post
&gt;&gt;2358052Thanks annon, I will consider this.
&gt;&gt;2358052We do make several suggestions before taking pills: diet, exercise, testosterone check, blood check, etc. Plus all the other warnings before resorting to pills. But yes, we will reconsider this approach. Thanks again for you input.
&gt;&gt;2358620These suggestions are a good call, it gives your website more authority and less of a &quot;sales&quot; feel.Also, my ED was triggered by massive performance anxiety. If you can find a good long tail keyword, consider building an article about this subject. You&#039;re sure to attract (and provide) for a lot of young, anxious guys.
&gt;&gt;2358721Yes, but if it is psychological and not a physical issue - you dont need pills. You need a psychologist. This issue is addressed on the site as well. But I guess we can push it more.
Kgc just increased volume by 4x in like 30 minutes, and went from 5 sat to 8 sat, and back down to 7 sat, a little bit left for you if you&#039;d like to get on before we rocket out of here
&gt;&gt;2358351Can someone tell me why I can&#039;t buy coins like these outright? On Yobit, Bleutrade, etc whenever I try to make a purchase it actually sends an order, not an actual instantaneous purchase.
&gt;&gt;2358351Make that 5x now
&gt;&gt;2358409Go away. You don&#039;t belong here.
&gt;&gt;2358409Are you trying to buy below the asking price?
&gt;&gt;2358409You always can buy outright, just buy into ask. You buy into bid you will wait, you buy into someone placing an ask already itll go within seconds.
&gt;&gt;2358351whats this? kentucky grilled chicken? I am in nigga
&gt;&gt;2358443&gt;&gt;2358452Ah I get it now. It&#039;s just that Yobit shows a different price in the sidebar than the actual buying price. Was confused for a second.
&gt;&gt;2358529Lmao
&gt;&gt;2358542Yeah the thing on the left doesn&#039;t update very quickly, also 10 sats fuck yeah
&gt;&gt;2358749WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IT&#039;S ALMOST DOUBLED IN 4 MINUTES GET IN HERE
Prices rises but cant even sell it back at 2 sats
&gt;&gt;2358831Pick up the super cheap weakhand bags dropping
Triangle closing. Last chance to buy.
&gt;&gt;2358865I heard the developer of this coin fucked a watermelon on youtube.Any links on that someon?
If you want a quick crypto profit, stop chasing disgusting YoBit shitcoins. And don&#039;t fall for anything shilled by Discord shills (they like targeting Bittrex-listed coins).Here is a POS coin that&#039;s growing NATURALLY, and days ago it was added to Cryptopia: 1337. It won&#039;t get dumped fast and you will not lose everything in an instant. It&#039;s got an active thread on Bitcointalk with 90+ pages and an active dev, and looks pretty neat overall: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1319833.01337 is on the rise, and it&#039;s a safe option to get a double or triple profit pretty soon. Join the game.https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange?market=1337_BTChttps://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange?market=1337_DOGE
&gt;&gt;2358614&gt;Pure POSI think that about sums it up you fucking pooinloo.
&gt;&gt;2358637It&#039;s an abbreviation for Proof of Stake, nocoiner
&gt;&gt;2358614&gt;&gt;2358662Sounds interesting, is it on any exchanges other than cryptopia?
&gt;&gt;2358681NovaExchange, CoinExchange and a couple of lesser exchangesConsidering that it was added to Cryptopia literally a couple of days ago, this is a sure sign it&#039;s growing

&gt;&gt;2358705&gt;&gt;2358711Thanks

So back in 2012, a friend recommended a big flat in a 10 story new built building in Alexandria Egypt, right in front of the beach.We both buy a flatFast Forward 1 year after renovating the flat the way I like it, marble floor, granite kitchen counter-top, ceramic floor bathroom etc...Civil war breaks loose and Egypt goes to shit. Now 5 years later still haven&#039;t found a good price to sell the flat.My questions:What do you suggest or recommend I do now?Wait a bit longer ?How&#039;s tourism there nowadays, will it grow?Should I furnish and start lodging for tourists, using airbnb.com or booking.com?Advice would be much appreciatedThanks in advancedPic related (balcony view before renovation)
&gt;&gt;2357266I think waiting is your best option to be honest. Maybe one die Sand dwellers will get their shit together and you can sell at a profit. Have you considering putting your flat rented for tourism?It seems to have a nice view, so it might work.
&gt;&gt;2357822yeah that&#039;s what I had in mind as I wrote in the post.But I need to know how tourism is there first, and more detail on how I would go about doing that correctlySatellite view of the area
is airbnb an option there? thats a sick view and could work depending on where it is in Egypt. Tourists are gravitating towards airbnb these days
&gt;buying property anywhere near the middle east.idiot.
&gt;&gt;2357882as I said in the post it&#039;s in Alexandriaalso this&gt;&gt;2357868&gt;&gt;2357890Yeah perhaps, but who would have guessed a civil war would occur
AirBnB it dude.
&gt;&gt;2357868Tourism has gone to shit with the civil war. Nowadays I never hear anybody talk about visiting Egypt, a few years ago it was a popular travel destination. People from my country always get diarrhea when they visit it.Also, the area in which your apartment is based doesn&#039;t look too tourist friendly. Doubt it&#039;ll ever blossom up.
&gt;&gt;2357933I&#039;ll put that in mind&gt;&gt;2357939yeah exactly, that&#039;s why I thought it was a good idea back then.Also the news about Egypt making a new city for it to be the capital east of Cario
&gt;&gt;2357902&gt;who would&#039;ve guessedshiet man, did u not read all the NWO memes
&gt;&gt;2358015back in 2012?I guess I didn&#039;tPlus it all started when the Tunisian guy burnt himself alive
Sisi is a typical Egyptian strongman of the Nasser era who is cleaning up the rat&#039;s nest, if he can keep it up and totally eliminate all traces of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Salafists it won&#039;t be long before Egypt is a safe tourist destination again.
&gt;&gt;2357902&gt;Yeah perhaps, but who would have guessed a civil war would occurYou bought property in a 3rd world shit hole near to war, starvation, poverty and genocide.idiot.
&gt;&gt;2358029how long would you give it?&gt;&gt;2358046We&#039;ve acknowledged that already, say something newand as i said at the time there was no war
&gt;&gt;2358107Honestly no clue, problem is the mideast is, things are heating up in the Gulf and a big Sunni/Arab war vs Shia/Iran could be brewing.Here is a creative idea though, with all the shit going on in the Gulf right now, instead of trying to sale to nervous westerners why don&#039;t you try and find a rich Arab buyer from the Gulf looking to get out of a region that could explode into war anytime now? Because if the middle east does descend into war at least Egypt is a few thousand miles away from where all the real fighting will go on.
&gt;&gt;2358107&gt;We&#039;ve acknowledged that already, say something new&gt;and as i said at the time there was no warNo you&#039;re a fucking idiot at the time as well, it&#039;s not &quot;oh, how come SUDDENLY civil breaks out&quot;, you need to look at the trends.If you see on your local news some dictator getting cocky and your next door country just finished genociding one group of people and children are blowing themselves up for religion in another neighbouring country you should KNOW its a shit place to do business.idiot.

&gt;&gt;2358196I don&#039;t see how this is helping the main topicIt was suddenly, in 2012 that stuff you mentioned was happening?Civil war had nothing to do with what extremists were doing. Civil war was first started in Tunis when a civilian lit himself on fire, then other middle east countries started protesting and you are telling me you predicted this would happen more than a year before this happened ?
&gt;&gt;2358025lmfao wtf? shit has been warming in that area since like the fucking 1970s bud
&gt;&gt;2358336no you idiot.you bought your apartment in a shitty part of the world. its no different than me wanting to buy an apartment in San Salvador or in Caracas, sure you got a place but the surrounding area is still shit.
&gt;&gt;2358393OP seems like he has an IQ lower than 95.Which likely means hes a smelly Arab.
&gt;&gt;2357902&gt;Yeah perhaps, but who would have guessed a civil war would occur/pol/
&gt;&gt;2357868Rent it out to tourists. You&#039;re on a beach ffs I think someone will definitely buy it out.Rent it out for a few years until the price goes up.
&gt;&gt;2358453yeah, exactly but then again are there any tourists ?
Jesus Christ GET OUT OF THERE. YINON PLAN. http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/The%20Zionist%20Plan%20for%20the%20Middle%20East.pdf
&gt;&gt;2358434not sure why you are so butt hurt mateI am sure you&#039;ve noticed you are the only one that&#039;s shit talkingyou and your likes are the cancer of this world
&gt;&gt;2357266&gt;he didn&#039;t buy bitcoin in 2012 insteadYou could&#039;ve been rich senpai
&gt;&gt;2358467Egypt is still a popular holiday destination. Not as popular as it was and package holidays in relatively safe resorts are much more popular so I don&#039;t think AirBnB or rental would do particularly good.
&gt;&gt;2357266cut your losses and learn to never buy any property in africa and/or muslim shitholes
Grow weed in your flat.
&gt;&gt;2358526yeah, it is unfortunate, I mean this flat I bought wasn&#039;t so expensive. Just wondering if I could make more profit or any other bright ideas&gt;&gt;2358536noted, thanks
&gt;&gt;2358561I don&#039;t my head shopped off, i&#039;ll pass&gt;&gt;2358557Deff. lesson learned
&gt;&gt;2358447Yeah and /pol/ has been saying there will be war in nearly every country
Seriously, you&#039;re a border port town for the renewed insistent calls for Greater Israel. Your life is going to be shit over the next decade if you don&#039;t cut your losses. You&#039;re living in a hotly contested area.
&gt;&gt;2358486&gt;you and your likes are the cancer of this worldyou bought a shitty apartment in an Islamic shithole.take me for an example, if i was to buy an apartment, I would chose places like New York, London, Vancouver, Hong Kong- Alpha cities and I do have an apartment in one of these cities.You chose a islamic shithole to buy an apartment which only means that you are an Arab or at the very least a muslim, which means your mean IQ is below 100 which constitutes why you&#039;d buy property in a shithole where the signs of civil war has been repeated time and time again since the 1970&#039;s.
I saved up $50,000 after wagecucking and started day trading crypto last year. Somehow I still fucked up and made losses of -$30,000. I still have $20,000 left but I give up. I tried and failed at day trading and I sure as hell don&#039;t want to be a wagecuck anymore.
Learn to HODL, I bet you buy schill dumps at 10 SATS and sell at 5. If you want to win, take 10k and throw it in DGB and learn to respect the will of the HODL. Or fall victim to more pajeets scamming your dumbass on yobit
How can you be so shit shoulda hodled
how the fuck do you lose money in a raging hyper bull market like this?
&gt;&gt;2357206&gt;daytradingHold you dum niggr
&gt;&gt;2357237HODL only works with bitcoin newfriend, as it is a bitcoin meme. Applying it to shitcoins will not end well.
&gt;&gt;2357206Literally everyone who tries to daytrade (ie newfags) does this. Don&#039;t kys, invest in some stable coins and wagecuck while HODLing. If you want, take $1,000 and do 2-week or so trades, buying up P&amp;D memecoins.You will be rich, eventually

&gt;&gt;2357206Just dump it all into eth/btc and some good alt coins and go get a real job.

IM YOUR DOCTOREAT YOUR MEDICINE AND TAKE AWAY FROM COMPUTERDO IT NOWhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gamblingProblem gambling (or ludomania, but usually referred to as &quot;gambling addiction&quot; or &quot;compulsive gambling&quot;) is an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler&#039;s behaviour. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common disorder that is associated with both social and family costs.
&gt;&gt;2357206so instead of day trading with a few hundred, you tossed in 50k your first time?thanks for giving me money but don&#039;t post here again.
Bait post.I invested 100k last month, I&#039;m now down to 10k after investing it all on mooncoin.Do you believe me?
&gt;&gt;2357206OP I&#039;m gonna be nice to you since I lost some on a shitcoin too (except I only had $500 to start so it wasn&#039;t that bad for me).I turned that loss into nearly 10k now btw. I started crypto only a few months ago.Here&#039;s my coins that have basically been giving me nothing but money nonstop:ETH, ANT, LUN, BTC, STRAT, UBQ, REPSTRAT and ETH made me the most money, that&#039;s how I turned my small amount into 10k and then diversified from there.Literally can&#039;t go fucking wrong holding these, you will get all your money back in a few months if you diversify into those or at least hold 3 of them if you want gains faster.If you want to gamble and get your money back even faster, put it into RDD, it&#039;s gonna have Redd-ID coming out, easiest gains with little effort, just need to be a bit patient.But take it from someone who is holding good coins, you will only get a few % each week but you will keep making money slowly at least.
&gt;&gt;2357358&gt;Literally everyone who tries to daytrade (ie newfags) does thisWrong.&gt;Nearly everyone who tries to daytrade (ie newfags) does thisCorrect.
Stop selling at a loss and u will never lose faggotDon&#039;t buy at all time highDiversify your portfoliohow tf did u lose 50k is beyond me
&gt;&gt;2357206can i have your stuff anon? i will remember you forever 1A2xjFq8gdDhCJPfWqEazsGBoQTL1xemzr
&gt;&gt;2357206You should&#039;ve put it in RDDI&#039;ve made 10x gainsThis is without Redd ID... not sure how you did that
Buy ripple it&#039;s going to shoot up in the next couple of days
Yup exactly. Avoid day trading like the plague, especially if you&#039;re new. Or get into it with a few hundred dollars first so you can learn the ropes... Try to make 1k, and so on.For fuck sakes OP. Start listening.Also avoid /biz/ for awhile and learn to read graphs, then you can gauge when to actually buy, vs being told to by shills on here.
Just invest 20k in 4 non-shitcoins, hodl, check back in 6 months and sell. You will probably be up. Never day trade.
Please, please, please teach me how to do the meme triangles
I&#039;m interested in this also, i need to step up the memes
show me using this if you can
Programmer chiming in on xby. Spent 8 hours looking at everything code, idea etc. It looks legit desu. BRB joining the dev team and praying I can get some xby from the fees XD
&gt;&gt;2358848if you actually get on the dev team i&#039;ll see you on the private channel friendo
Do we receive compensation? I have a summer to burn!
&gt;&gt;2358896They might not need new devs yet. They just expanded not too long ago. Definitely let them know you are interested though for the future.This coin is the only one I hold with the potential to go to a dollar.
Bought this shit at 10$
&gt;&gt;2358034Stratis to 100$ in 2 months
&gt;&gt;2358313Why? its a clone of an already useless coin.
&gt;&gt;2358034it was 10.70 todayso you&#039;re just retarded
&gt;&gt;2358313agreed, at least 50-60ish
Bought at 3 4 5 and 7.watched everybody go crazy these past couple of days and laughed my ass off
I bought some strat at higher price. Not worried. It is going up mega fast and is accumulating now.
bought this at 1 dollar and this shit is just resting. moved 8 dollars in less than a week.
&gt;&gt;2358394bought most of my Strat below $3. haven&#039;t even considered selling any of it.
Do you guys have any predictions ? Could we get to 50 by the end of the year or it&#039;s too optimistic ?
&gt;&gt;2358615Holding since 60 cents.Not selling a single STRAT until it&#039;s 3 digits.
&gt;&gt;2358615Think 25 would be reasonable
&gt;&gt;2358629Damn.i wish I would have hopped on the train that early.still I&#039;m ok with my 1075 strat
&gt;&gt;2358629Next year I guess we ll see two digits.anyways the breeze wallet launch is gonna take it to 15 easy
&gt;&gt;2358034Sell then you uninformed cuck. STRAT is one of the few coins that you won&#039;t loose on in the long run.
&gt;&gt;2358725&gt;breeze wallet launchDo we have an estimated date for that?
&gt;&gt;2358725&gt;next year we&#039;ll see two digitsWe&#039;are currently at two digits.

&gt;&gt;2358479&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;investors&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; think they are buying a piece of the next AAPL here
&gt;&gt;2358500but they dont realize AAPL was already a profitable company for a decade before it exploded(except for that one time microsoft bailed them out because the gov&#039;t told them to)
&gt;&gt;2358396still worth buying even now?
&gt;&gt;2358512wait spin you don&#039;t like TSLA?
&gt;&gt;2358545I FUCKING HATE TESLAmost overvalued shit tradable todaymore overvalued than a bitcoin ffs
&gt;sold X and LTBR after yesterday&#039;s gains thinking they would correct and go back down&gt;kept going up todayRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWaiting for dips in: AAOI, LTBR, HIMX, X
&gt;&gt;2358548i can&#039;t tell if you&#039;re being serious spin please explainnah i&#039;m just kidding i think everyone knows you hate TSLA
&gt;&gt;2358559DO YOU REALLY THINK HES GOING TO MOVE 500K CARS AT $35K EACH (minimum)THE MARKET FOR VEHILES AT THAT PRICE POINT IS NOT BIG ENOUGHPLUS THE OTHER COMPANIES ARE CATCHING UP WITH THEIR OWN E.V.&#039;SPLUS GAS PRICES ARE FALLING
&gt;&gt;2358479My belief: Tech stocks are valued differently on fundamentals.What matters? Are cash inflows growing, are your revenues growing? Are you able to service debt in a timely manner to continue growing?If earnings increase, it&#039;s simply a bonus as many of the big nasdaq companies are growth share companies, so why should you care about earnings if you&#039;re not receiving any share of that as a partial owner? And lower profit means less tax which means more cash for growth.Tech stocks are the future, big funds know this which why they&#039;re buying the shit out of them. Retail, as we know it, will disappear over the next 50 years.
&gt;&gt;2358479tldr, elaborate on musk and tesla in the context of this coin
&gt;&gt;2358581BMW alone sold 2 million cars last year.
&gt;&gt;2358603got a source on this?BMW sold 106k of its 3 series / 4 series (for some reason these get reported together) in 2016 in the UShttp://carsalesbase.com/us-car-sales-data/bmw/bmw-3-series-4-series/
&gt;&gt;2358631i looked at that car model because it seems the most equatable to the tesla model 3
&gt;&gt;2358581You need to shut the fuck up. You don&#039;t know shit about shit.
&gt;&gt;2358581No need for caps bid/ask bro. Everyone with a functioning brain (so no one on l3ddit, even fewer people on the market, and about half of /biz/) thinks TSLA is overpriced. I mean, I like elon musk&#039;s dank memes, but it remains overpriced due to normies OMG TSLA LOLOLL.
&gt;&gt;2358646muh Elon the saviormuh green futuremuh neural net mars mission hyperloop tunnel solar roof panel electric airplanesits w-worth a million billion trillion dollars!!!
&gt;&gt;2358559elon musk himself has said that his company is overvalued
&gt;&gt;2358692nah i know dog. i&#039;m not defending it. i do like TSLA from far away but i wouldn&#039;t bet my life on that company lol

&gt;dumping your DGB at a loss so whales can scoop up more profits and you&#039;re left holding the bags&gt;not realizing that this one day dip is free money when it completely recovers in 2 days and moons again in a monthYou&#039;re way more likely to lose money spastically watching the charts and trying to follow the market. just believe in the tech, hodl, and check again in a month. The entire market will be back up again, no need to lose money in the short term by selling.
&gt;&gt;2358762Nah OP you&#039;re retarded, sometimes its just easier to dump and move the btc into something that will actually make you more money in the time that it&#039;ll take for your bags to recover.This is one of those situations
OP is one of the few among the ranks of the legendary PoSW bagholders
&gt;&gt;2358762It&#039;s true but I see too many people trying to catch a rocket to the moon over night. I hodl this for another 6 months if it doesn&#039;t grow I am out. DON&#039;T INVEST WHAT YOU CAN&#039;T AFFORD TO LOSE FFS! I will admit I thought about selling PLENTY of times but in the long run I FEEL it will be a great investment.

We&#039;re really are gonna make it this time senpai.P.S. check out the proposal on the Ark forumshttps://forum.ark.io/topic/341/biz-the-little-guy-s-delegate-90-payout-transparent-sharing-pool
&gt;&gt;2349374Fucking basedI &#039;m trying to get some more ARK so far 220 in the wallet
how much will I win by doing this?
&gt;&gt;2349374Kek sure faggot
&gt;&gt;2349374Get it on other sites as well?
How do I get in on this? i have 9k ark waht do
&gt;&gt;2350126our current thread is here&gt;&gt;2348666(it was in this thread&#039;s OP dude c&#039;mon open your eyes)
&gt;&gt;2350158poop dollar
How much does it cost to vote? And how much time is left?
im new to ark, how does this make money?how much is payout if i&#039;ll invest 100$ and this thing goes as planned?
&gt;&gt;2350545The way it works is we have get our delegate to start forging, and everyone who voted for him reaps the rewards. 400 tokens will be dispersed per day and spread amongst all voters, so you stand to make gains by making more coins, which will inevitably rise in value.
&gt;&gt;2350571uh, do you mind explaining these delegates and where the coins come from?more coins on OP&#039;s thing, more I get them per day?
&gt;&gt;2349374Glad to be on this boat with you guys! We are gonna make it to 51 before this weekend!
&gt;&gt;2350571bumb
&gt;&gt;2349374&gt;tfw the biz delegation takes 51st
Bought a handful more ARK last night to add to the pool. Not a whole lot and my timing ended up being fucking terrible, but it all adds up
&gt;&gt;2349164i just bought 270 more arks to get to 1000, going to vote for BIZ ones i got them in my wallet.This just became a long term hold
&gt;&gt;2350515voting never ends, it costs 1 ark to vote and it doesnt get collected by anyone involved in the biz pool its just the fee for voting. the amount of ark you hold in the client is the weight of your vote. the more weight you have the more you get paid in the weekly Ark payout.We have raised $338,375 worth of crypto in under 3 days. This pays everyone who votes with ark in their wallet. You risk pretty much nothing by doing this.Active thread with links and help and shit&gt;&gt;2348666&gt;&gt;2348666&gt;&gt;2348666
&gt;&gt;2350606Read uphttps://blog.ark.io/how-to-vote-or-un-vote-an-ark-delegate-and-how-does-it-all-work-819c5439da68
&gt;&gt;2351081I&#039;ll be adding another 9k to the pool tomorrow, once I get my next payout from my current delegate tomorrow.
this is truly the power of autism
&gt;&gt;2351153Isn&#039;t it glorious?
&gt;&gt;2349164&gt;&gt;2351080&gt;&gt;2351094Reminder that you&#039;re voting for a technologically inept NEET that is running the payouts manually through Windows in his mom&#039;s basement instead of using a proper cronjob through AWS or some other VPS.Get your shit together /biz/.
&gt;&gt;2351176Fine, if he proves to be inept, we&#039;ll move votes. I&#039;m going to give him a chance though. That&#039;s why this system is awesome. Sorry about your missed opportunity to funnel more ARK into your private wallets heliohash.
wait, If I vote this from 1000 wallets with balance of 1, would it make way more money than voting from one wallet with 1000A?
&gt;&gt;2351240No less. You vote and the balance then determines the weight.
https://explorer.ark.io/tx/2f5ce179563a5aee98803aaad1b44f5b118348628db3bf08d44218d57554548e
&gt;&gt;2351176Give him a chance dude. He seems like a good guy, and if he turns out to be incompetent then just change your vote.
&gt;&gt;2351230&gt;&gt;2351281I never said he was bad. He&#039;s just not the right person to trust with distributing votes because he can&#039;t into computers.
&gt;&gt;2349490https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGo3FkC3uSWXGHatPQyny2brMWjAIJsHFCR-Lhkl_m0/edit#gid=0We&#039;d be beating the best of these rates but this gives you an idea.
&gt;&gt;2351289Which makes him personally ideal for me because he&#039;s going to have to bust ass and be proficient - also since he&#039;s new and has a chance to make some cash, I think he&#039;ll put a lot of work into it and getting it right, instead of veterans and pools.He may screw the pooch - but if he runs off, he lost his ticket.
&gt;&gt;2351289You didn&#039;t take the initiative, better someone slightly worse with computers that takes initiative than a lazy Stallman.
&gt;&gt;2351289he is completely dependent on us, not the other way around. if he fucks up, we pull out. it&#039;s that simple. he will do whatever he needs to keep us
If I add more Ark to my wallet after I voted, do I need to revote to establish that I have a greater share of Ark in our delegate system, and therefore earn more profit based off that?
&gt;&gt;2351520No, your weight is dynamic so whenever you add/remove ark from your wallet your voting weight changes accordingly.
I have a thousand ark lying around, where do I go and what do I do?
&gt;&gt;2351289reply to me in the other thread faggot
&gt;&gt;2351534Good to know, thanks for the reply
&gt;&gt;2351572
&gt;&gt;2351572first go to ark.io, download the client, make an account write down your password, then send ur 1000 ark to the client address, then go to voting, click add delegate type biz, ok, then vote, voting costs 1 ARK, the rest stays with you.
How much more ark we need? I only have like 700.
&gt;&gt;2351603&gt;&gt;2351610thanks you two ... am doing this right now
&gt;&gt;2351640We&#039;re almost top 51 lad. After that it&#039;s literally free money assuring us of more free money to come. Digits will confirm.
we need like 450k more ark to get spot 51...unless another high roller takes pity on us I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to make it guys
&gt;&gt;2351666&gt;Digits will confirm&gt;2351666CON-FUCKING-FIRMED!!1!LAMBOLAND HERE WE COMEAPOLLO COULDNT MAKE IT BUT WE WILL
&gt;&gt;2351693We&#039;re getting over 100k a day not even counting the 100k whale that jumped on board, stop being so impatient.
&gt;&gt;2351666Where can I see the ranking?
&gt;&gt;2351718In your Ark wallet, under &quot;Votes&quot; it&#039;ll have your wallet address and underneath will be any delegates you voted for.
&gt;&gt;2351718https://www.arknode.net/VoteReport.txt
Okay fags where do I buy ark
&gt;&gt;2351746bittrex
&gt;&gt;2351746Bittrex my niggaIt will probably be on Polo soon. It&#039;s a really solid project.
&gt;&gt;2351746good time to buy too.Also, I&#039;m fairly convinced that we&#039;ve taken about 100BTC out of exchange circulation in the past 36hours which adds up to about $280K-300k (which also aligns with our delegate).It&#039;s really interesting
&gt;&gt;2351666checked, oh boy
voted, how can you know who is participating? is there a list or something
Been accumulating for the past 2 days!Adding to my wallet tonight, already voted for biz.
Uhh, I&#039;m thinking something is just about to happen.....
&gt;&gt;2358346I would buy this coin if the site was more legit.
&gt;&gt;2358346&gt;Volume has just doubled guise!&gt;Clearly someone dumping for the last several days every time there are a few bigger buy ordersFuck out of here Pajeet with your exit scam
&gt;&gt;2358346I also noticed this tighten your seatbelts
&gt;&gt;2358346&gt;&gt;2358589&gt;plz take these heavy bags off our hands
&gt;&gt;2358463/thread
&gt;&gt;2358463&gt;&gt;2358754marketing guy has confirmed the site will be coming next week, lets hope for your sake the price doesn&#039;t rise too much before then
&gt;&gt;2358768&gt;marketing guy&gt;prophet of our ages
&gt;&gt;2358837sure why not
With all the shitty altcoin pump and dumps that you guys seem to partake in, is it not a lot more sensible to just invest all your money longterm in BTC and ETH, and maybe 100$ in one shitcoin and wait 2 weeks before selling? Seems foolproof.
&gt;&gt;2358767No./biz/ just needs to learn to work as a team, and not cheat each other.
&gt;&gt;2358767Yes. Not a bad plan. You should still follow news and prices though in case something big happens. I only make a few trades a week, and the day trading I do is always in coins that I&#039;d feel comfortable holding long term in case the price dips and I get stuck.
&gt;&gt;2358807How can you work as a team when we&#039;re all anonymous and shills can easily infiltrate?
&gt;&gt;2358807This too. But it&#039;s the fucking prisoner&#039;s dellemna. We could have 90% agreement on a course of action and then a few bad apples could screw everyone else over.
&gt;&gt;2358819I feel if I follow news too closely I get paranoid and make shit decisions. Literally everyone who has held bitcoin has now made a profit. Everyone. I think I just have to keep telling myself that.
&gt;&gt;2358767I doubt that they&#039;re much potential for large gains in the current crypto market. Pretty much every coin that could has shot up at least 10x and is currently stagnant or declining.There&#039;s only a handful of coins on this current wave that have enough utility to compete besides BTC and ETH. Save your money for the inevitable crash.
&gt;&gt;2358853In a years time btc will be up at least 50% and eth 100+%. Is that not a lot better than risking it on shitcoins that are controlled by shills?
&gt;https://blog.wavesplatform.com/russian-billionaire-announces-business-incubator-on-waves-platform-7e9f57ab50ab&gt;Russian billionaire announces business incubator on Waves platform&gt;Boris Titov, the Russian business ombudsman and billionaire politician, is creating a new initiative for entrepreneurs and growing companies, hosted on the Waves blockchain.&gt;mfw you still don&#039;t own any WAVESAnon, why you don&#039;t want to get rich?
&gt;&gt;2357614The founder of this coin Sasha Ivanov is a convicted felon and scammer.Google him.
What are you talking about OP? Of course I hold waves, Why wouldnt I want to become rich af?
&gt;&gt;2357635&gt;AUTISMO
&gt;&gt;2357635Please post proofKeep pretending fag, cry when you see us in lambos
&gt;&gt;2357635trying to google not finding what he was convicted for - any info?
&gt;&gt;2357687&gt;inb4 he posts the bad interview video of these two unprofesional fat fucks with autismo activated
&gt;&gt;2357687Google it in fucking Russian you dumbass.The moment Sasha Ivanov sets foot in the US he ends up in jail.
&gt;&gt;2357718&gt;He actually thinks this&gt;Still no proof
Gonna need the verdict on this convicted felon ordeal because I&#039;m willing to throw $150 in today
Waves made 10x and still has room for 2x or 3x.It has a well functioning token issuing platform, and they are implementing what they have been promising.For me it is a good investment considering ETH is overvalued.This is like the little ETH brother but different and it is only 5.
&gt;&gt;2357751Do it, if you want to drive lamboWavesplatform is actually one of the less coins who bring actually value and constant updates into cryptoworld&gt;Azure approved&gt;iOS app&gt;Decentralized Exchange&gt;NASDAQ Article&gt;Trezor soon&gt;... That was just in the past 1-2 Months alone
&gt;&gt;2357718I&#039;m a dumbass because I can&#039;t find anything online about it? Or you&#039;re a dumbass because you&#039;re unable to post a link?
&gt;&gt;2357718I kek on you
ETH will fall hard, too complicated, mark my words, waves is easy as fuck compared to eth, 17/19$ by the end of the year!
&gt;&gt;2358241Its true, anyone that tried making coin on waves and eth will tell you the same thing.
how does a coin even made?
They have a nice platform going, would have gotten in earlier if I wasn&#039;t such a newfag.
&gt;only have 500 waves.No lambo for me, maybe a fiat panda.
&gt;&gt;2358457Dude, think in terms of years not weeks. That will be more than enough for a Lambo.
&gt;&gt;2357635t. Stratis
bouncing in about... now
I warned you, broke fucks
&gt;&gt;2358756No buy support for those coins and the devs own 50% of the supply.Very shady and scammy
&gt; missed out at $1&gt; missed out on $2&gt; missed out on $3so what&#039;s your excuse for missing out on $4?
&gt;&gt;2358723Max Kordek is going to jail
today we find out who has the strongest hands of them all
&gt;&gt;2358129looks like its gonna moon desu
&gt;&gt;2358138the only thing tightening of the bollinger band tells you is a big price movement comingmarket depth tells a different story, and has been for the last 2 weeks.
&gt;&gt;2358129If it crashes we&#039;re all going to fucking dieeveryone please pray that we&#039;ll moon
What do? Sell to usd?
&gt;&gt;2358306pray
Will either moon or dip hard. Dip just means ill buy more
&gt;&gt;2358129It might enter a two year long decline to 1/5 of it&#039;s moon value, just like last time BTC hit a new ATH and normies started paying attention. In which case, remind me to invest in BTC in roughly June of 2019.
&gt;&gt;2358306pray it stays stable, doesn&#039;t moon or crash. Just stay where it is forever.Fuck BTC
Guys get rid of the studies and just look at the bare candlesticks. They bring too much of the past into the equation, plus the lines move around on the chart as more bars are added. In the early 1990a I met this guy in the Bahamas who lost hos whole family fortune and his mind trying to trade futures with SMACs. Because he looked at the chart 20 bars ago and it was givng perfect entry signals and he didn&#039;t realize that the lines only give perfect entry signals in the past, not the present (because where they are on the chart now is not where they&#039;ll be 20 bars from now).
&gt;&gt;2358704I hope that happens. I want to see it crash to fill my pockets.
even though i predicted the outcome of ripple for the coming weeks on may 26th for myself, i decided to hold because it will rise one dayi painted the top image on 26th of maybottom one is a screenshot from today
Renter here. How long will it last?
&gt;&gt;2357513Forever. Move somewhere cheaper
&gt;&gt;2357513where the fuck is this? I thought NE was expensive
is that a 2 million dollar cuck shack?
&gt;&gt;2357513I&#039;m calling bullshit in that listing. Either it&#039;s someone having a laff or it&#039;s shooped
&gt;&gt;2357513Not anytime soon.
&gt;&gt;2357575Probably Vancouver
&gt;&gt;2357613Mate call dad. What a fucked up id

&gt;&gt;2357623IS YOUR DAD OK?
Look to China to see how long it&#039;ll last - since that 15% foreign tx tax and 1% unoccupied dwellings tax merely slowed the market down; its ATH nowYou either need a nationalist in government (LOL won&#039;t happen) or extreme Chinese capital controls, which might happenFurthermore, I&#039;m unsure what effect a Chinese economic collapse would have but that might do it too. Might accelerate the housing price boom as well.
&gt;&gt;2357623RESCUE YOUR FATHER FROM THE BELLY OF THE WHALE
&gt;&gt;2357613&gt;&gt;2357623I fucking love IDs.
&gt;&gt;2357613&gt;&gt;2357623Literally kek is speaking to you.
&gt;&gt;2358047He will call me later today.
&gt;&gt;2358246CALL HIM NOW
&gt;&gt;2358246I wouldn&#039;t wait m8kek has spoken - you know he is a vengeful god
&gt;&gt;2357623So when are you calling me son?
&gt;&gt;2357513Eventually people will get tired of that shit and convince the city to rezone some of that to high density multifamily so actual apartments and condos can go in and bring down costs.But currently nimbly reins supreme
&gt;&gt;2357513What the fuck? Where is that?
&gt;&gt;2357513Until you buy some crypto so you can afford a $2.4 million shack.
&gt;&gt;2358618fucking gold. the ID and thread made /biz/ worth it today, was pretty close to ending it after reading so much stupidity and completely losing faith in humanity.thank you kek
Fuck my life in to pieces
What the fuck were you guys expecting? Buy into the tech, not the goddamn mean. Jared could have at least had some professional slides.Anyway rip.
It will come back, for sure, really! Buy the dip
&gt;&gt;2356500&gt;gonna put this giant ass picture of a boat right here. yup looks good!
Jared is a fuckclown I no longer trust him
&gt;&gt;2356530hahahahahaha&gt;wipes tears from eyes after laughing too hardyea guys. buy the dip.hahahaha
I warned you about the whale cartel and you didn&#039;t listenyou deserve this, it only gets worse
DGB was at under 100 sats for years, 4chan uses meme magic to gain help gain attention, a literal fake news minecraft mod server that retards believed was a microsoft partnership helped fuel a massive moon, and combined with a Citibank presentation in fucking Signapore leads everybody to think it&#039;s the real deal.wow. thanks for the easy money tho. I will be buying back in at 400 sats next week.at least you got the dgb chan lewds.
&gt;&gt;2356461happy to see that retards still exist who give their money to anyone who asks for it.can you buy some ARK and WAVES?
&gt;&gt;2356577PROTIPmooncoin
&gt;&gt;2356549&gt;we are a professional organization
I&#039;m noticing some posts are disappearing for some reason but I&#039;ll repost this for the luls
&gt;&gt;2356635yeah, maybe i should have left that ironically
Or wait... muh internet? Anyway... he obviously whipped that up about 30 minutes before the presentation. probably spent the night in his hotel room snorting cocaine off of some sweet singapore ass with your monies
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
&gt;&gt;2356635Jared body language looks nervous and closed like he is expecting to be attacked or something, while the audience shows disinterest.I mean, look at the fucking unprofessional slide; i&#039;ve seen university students make better slides that this shit.Thats likely why he didn&#039;t win, because he was a stuttering autist and his slides were shit and pitched the idea in pure technical terms that normies don&#039;t give a shit about.
&gt;&gt;2356667he&#039;s practicing his master grip for all the bags he forget to put stop loses on.
&gt;&gt;2356635this numpty couldn&#039;t dump some of his own coin and buy a suit and tie?
Lmao OP bought at the literal peak
Im going down with the ship. I&#039;ll hold my dgb to the bitter end.
Calm your tities&quot;We are very much looking forward to the main global @citi #CitiT4IChallenge awards that will be presented in July! $5 M USD+ in awards!&quot;
I bought in at 2250, no regrets, it will be up in a day again, higher than ever before, you&#039;ll see
&gt;&gt;2356709Source?
&gt;&gt;2356709&gt;we lost the regional against x group but surely we have chance against x+y+z+a+b+c groups in the global
&gt;&gt;2356739https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin/status/873130313181954048
&gt;&gt;2356732&gt;I bought in at 2250, no regrets, it will be up in a day again, higher than ever before, you&#039;ll see
&gt;&gt;2356740The regional awards are more fluff anyway (peer award, really?). I am not concerned. You&#039;re tech could be talking teddy bears that sing kids to sleep in Darfur and you would win that peer award. Doesn&#039;t mean that much. There is still one more regional one and then they will announce the overall awards next month.At the time I post this, people are still buying at 1920sats.
&gt;&gt;2356696pretty much any coin that has been in the news will keep going up until bitcoin bubble bursts. that might not happen for a long time.but just some advice: always sell before a big, hyped event/report for any stock/coin. that price is likely already including the near-best case scenario for the event. in a lot of popular markets it&#039;s just guaranteed that thousands of new people will just barely get in on something on the last minute because they are fucking morons, and then the news comes out and stop losses dump everything back down to what it should be
&gt;&gt;2356461SUFFOCATION. NO BREATHING.
What do you guys think about coin faucets ?There are good ones ? Will I lost my time ?
Well you missed out on the KGC dip and now there&#039;s only a tiny bit left of 8 sat (.015 btc). 8 sat was our biggest wall for a while (at .045 btc lmao) so once we get past this there&#039;s no stopping until 20 sats, better get in quick
lmao this shit actually seems like an easy fucking pump. if biz just gets on this bullshit and pumps it to heaven (30/40 sats) we&#039;ll be drivin lambos
&gt;&gt;2358562And just like that, all out of 8 sat, 20 sat here we come!
&gt;&gt;2358562Looked away for like 10 minutes and we&#039;re at 10 sats what the fuck, 20 sats in the next hour for sure
&gt;&gt;2358562&gt;&gt;2358592&gt;&gt;2358598&gt;&gt;2358733obvious samefag yoshitter. S A G E
&gt;&gt;2358733How about in the next 10 min holy fuck
WE ARE GOING INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION
&gt;See BlackCoin shilled yesterday&gt;today its up 90%wtf? how do you guys do it?
Buy nett coin. It&#039;s being accumulated.. give it a few weeks.See you soon.
&gt;&gt;2358132Listen to Romano on twitter always listen to Romano

WHY THE FUCK DIDN&#039;T YOU LISTEN, I TOOK THIS PIC 3 MINUTES AGO AND IT&#039;S ALREADY UP TO 15
&gt;&gt;2358766YES BRO I GOT IN AT 7 SATS, ROCKETEER MODE ACTIVATED !
&gt;&gt;2358792aAHHH
ahahahahahahahahhaa&gt;&gt;2350658told you fuckin morons&quot;NICE COPE NICE FUD HAAHAHAHA&quot;
Are you guys ready for the Boardwalk launch?The SC github has been on fire the last couple of days!Here&#039;s the announcement video to get you in the mood!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p90jKZiIaIU&amp;t=0s
BANCOR = SCAM
&gt;&gt;2354916Where&#039;s the proof? :( Unless there is proof that this is the case this is just some retard sperging out spreading FUD.
&gt;&gt;2354958What he says is factual. Whether it&#039;s a scam is a different subject.
&gt;&gt;2354916This rustled my jimmies more than anything desu.first they make an ico on certain capped conditions, promote bitcoin suisse to enthusiasts who want to get in earlythen they see the success of BAT and do a u turn after gauging market interest via btcsuisse, change the ico conditions and say &#039;lmao thanks for the free money&#039;i should have seen this age old jewry from miles away. I was going to put 10k in this in the hopes of getting BAT like returns, then i would put my profits into the next big thing. repeat this a couple of times and i&#039;d be well on my way to financial independencejews will ALLWAYS fuck you over
&gt;&gt;2354971Where can I find this to confirm?
&gt;&gt;2354916The dev team of Bancor is literally all web devs. I have no idea why /biz/ does not see through them. Stop with this fucking retarded jew meme. Yes, jews have amazing financial success. That doesn&#039;t mean they are going to make YOU any money. This is a cash grab plain and simple. They are fucking playing everyone. This could not be more transparent after they changed their tune after the huge BAT ico. This is a $500M scam. Their coin doesn&#039;t even work.
&gt;&gt;2355046The worst part is the whole &quot;funds from our crowdsale will go to the contributors and supporters of the dev team&quot; aka jewsYou&#039;re literally handing money to jews if you participate in the ICO. Blatant cash grab.
SCAM OR NOT, THOSE WHO SIDE WITH THE ((((THEMS)))) GONNA BE FUCKEN RICH
&gt;&gt;2355089Yeah, because they are known for sharing, right? You deserve to lose all of your money, you fucking loser.
&gt;&gt;2355111kekked and checked...
&gt;&gt;2355089Honestly I see this as a pretty solid long term hold
&gt;&gt;2355155You&#039;re right. You&#039;ll be holding it forever
with a .25B cap, since you only get 50%, you&#039;d need it to go to 5B for 10x and 50B for 100x.possible?
&gt;this picture
&gt;&gt;2355293Once the crypto market cap totals in &gt; 1 trillion easily
Can I still get my ETH back from BitcoinSuisse now that they are scamming?
they said , you will get your money back if you inform them at least 24 hours before the ico
&gt;&gt;2355518Yes, they will pay the fees too apparently.
&gt;&gt;2355506Why do women ruin everything and make it about themReminder to only invest in projects with an all-male team
&gt;&gt;2355734Preferably autists
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1789222.1400Read the whole thing before you start spouting other people&#039;s fud
https://blog.bancor.network/the-community-of-the-currency-9770087fde17This ICO will get attention, and these Jews will have plenty of shekels to make more shekels. Always bet with (((them)))
&gt;&gt;2355849More jewish tricks.
In all honestly, the idea of this project has massive financial potential, but they are ruining everything with this bullshit.
&gt;&gt;2355888Play jewish games, win jewish prizes.
This is so perxplexxing.its a genius idea but the absolute trickery from the developers rings alarm bells. You should see this slimy bancor fuck in the slack&gt;dude we care about investors and the project so much thats why i cant reveal the hidden market cap lmaohowever even if the ICO raises 100 mil, if crypto takes off into a few more $100 billion, i can see bancor being an easy long term 10x.its a gamble desu
They need to provide the &#039;hidden cap&#039; to a reputable 3rd party who will make it known if it is breached or if they try to raise it after the ICO begins.
&gt;&gt;2355950I want in on this gamble but the fucking mountain jews still haven&#039;t approved me and I can&#039;t get access during the ico.REEEEEEE YOU SAID I WAS IN THE QUEUE
You idiots the sharks are fudding this on purpose.Wings predicts around 50 million market cap of ico. This means plenty of room for profit.bancor already sai that if they raise a realyl big sum they will dimply rebuy into the contract you imbeciles.They have bent backwards for the community and all of this is just FUD cause sharks want to get in and get a lower market cap.Rmember sharks fudded Gnosis and BAT and in both cases ico investors made bank.
&gt;&gt;2356128stop spelling it out for these autists.
&gt;&gt;2354916&gt;getting (((jewcucked)))Anyone who spent one shekel deserves the ass pounding they&#039;ve received
&gt;&gt;2356116ive send my application on monday got accepted on wednesday
&gt;&gt;2356116I think if you weren&#039;t accepted by 9PM yesterday or so, it ain&#039;t happening :/.Saw something along those lines in the TG/Slack
If you&#039;re going to invest in a company that&#039;s literally comprised of ALL jews, then I don&#039;t know what to fucking say.
LmaoHow to find a great ico:Got to /biz/ see whales fudging project for more gains.Buy in get rich.Talked with the devs a lot the project will succeed with or without you.
There are 2 caps, a hidden cap that will be revealed if it is exceeded in the limitless hour, and a 1m eth cap for the security of Ethereum as a whole. The 1m eth probably wont be hit. see&gt;&gt;2356128If the hidden cap is exceeded (probably will be) Bancor will set a smart contract to buy BNT at ico price (.01eth), mitigating investor loss due to over-valuation. 80% of excess will buy BNT and 20% will be added to the reserve.See https://blog.bancor.network/the-community-of-the-currency-9770087fde17Here&#039;s one of the architects of the Euro backing Bancorhttps://www.i24news.tv/en/tv/replay/DEBRIEF/x5pj9yuNever doubt the (((true))) master race.
&gt;&gt;2356327The hidden cap will not be enforced within the first hour....if contributions in 1st hour exceed the hidden cap, the cap becomes whatever has been contributed after the hour finishes and the ICO ends then.&gt;Architect of the EuroIs this meant to provide confidence? lmao
&gt;&gt;2356343Go ahead and ignore the huge buywall they will put in there. I bet you wouldnt buy a coin that puts a 100.000 eth buywall on a coin that wont be pulled lmaoBancor will set a smart contract to buy BNT at ico price (.01eth), mitigating investor loss due to over-valuation. 80% of excess will buy BNT and 20% will be added to the reserve.
&gt;&gt;2356343You didn&#039;t read the blog post, or even my post. The first hour is limitless but if it exceeds the hidden cap the extra eth will be buying BNT at ico price, preventing a post-ico sell off
&gt;&gt;2355849&gt;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1789222.1400thanks for doing OPs job
&gt;&gt;2356377if he doesn&#039;t understand the significance of (essentially) a huge buy wall at the ICO price, don&#039;t even bother.
&gt;&gt;2356377so they will buy their own BTN token back with your money?
&gt;&gt;2356367&gt;&gt;2356377&gt;&gt;2356394s-sorry boys, didn&#039;t read it first.Still hinges on trusting that they stick to their hidden cap/hoping that it&#039;s not too high.
&gt;&gt;2356394Yeah you right. Let the normie GOYIM stay poor. It takes a modicum of intelligence to understand the magnitude of Bancor.
&gt;&gt;2356240&gt;&gt;2356256:( I applied saturday
&gt;&gt;2355506kay im outwas going to go balls deep in to it but this picture made me drop the ball in a heart beatthanks for sharing anon, could have made a mistake of a life time
&gt;&gt;2356664&gt;chooses to stay poor
Where will ico be? What website? And do you need a bancor wallet? Think il prob chuck 50dollars in for the he&#039;ll of it
&gt;&gt;2356717bancor wallet? how do newfags come up with this dumb shit.it&#039;s very simple. set up a private ether wallet (e.g. myetherwallet), send ether to your MEW, send ether from your wallet to Bancor&#039;s ICO address (details will be published on their website at the appropriate time), tokens will be automatically sent back to your ether wallet.
&gt;&gt;2356835Ok thank you. I already have an ether wallet so that&#039;s easy
With Jews you lose.Remember, always do the opposite of what Jews say.
Very good point, I think they have been absolutely discusting in the crypto communityShady ass fucking scamming ICOPiece of shits going to be remembered as a scamcoin
&gt;&gt;2355089You have not done any businesss with jews if you think that. They will smile at you and talk to you like you&#039;re their best friend, until the day they find an opportunity to run away with your money. Even if you lack personal experience, there are notable public examples. Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins, for example... who, incidentally, went on to newer and bigger ventures in the crypto space, while Facebook is content to remain a stagnating money-making machine.Whites create, Jews market and reap the profits. This is the law of business.
&gt;&gt;2354979In the ICO contract, apparently.
&gt;&gt;2357113&gt;make post about jews&gt;post somewhere else&gt;Error: You Are BannedKind of pointless if you don&#039;t also scrub out the offending post, Jacob.
&gt;&gt;2356479&gt;&gt;2356240why would you want that, it&#039;s uncapped the first hour?
&gt;&gt;235804280% of excess funds will be used to buyback at ICO price (if it drops to that level).lets say you saw an order book for a recently launched, extremely ambitious crypto project, and there was a fucking massive buy wall supporting the price. would you buy in?I don&#039;t know what else you neets want...
&gt;&gt;2358397i was asking why would you want to use bitcoin suisse for presale when there&#039;s no cap
&gt;&gt;2358473ah, fair enough.there is a chance people will still spam crazy high fees and clog the network. a lot of people will be waiting till the last 10-15 minutes to see how much has been raised before investing (which could lead to a BAT-like situation).I invested through BTC suisse just for peace of mind.
&gt;&gt;2358488i know after bat the whole network was practically unusable for a while, but does anybody know can there be so many transactions with high fees to fill an hour worth and it&#039;s impossible to get in within the hour? Or does that hour mean, everybody that sent within that hour is in, even if it takes a lot more time for them to get there?Also, if i use 1million gas, and it doesnt go through, how much does that cost me?
Guys Im about to drop 10 BTC on (((bancor))), should I do it ?
&gt;&gt;2358042because I cannot access computer during ico.
&gt;&gt;2356367&gt;80% of excess will buy BNT and 20% will be added to the reserve.if that&#039;s actually true, we should hope that contributions exceed the hardcap. If my calculations are right with 200k hardcap and 500k raised in total it could pump the price x3 from the ICO level
Do it for yourself anon... Do it for the future of your gains...*vanishes*
&gt;&gt;2358513Waves and Ethereum are much better investments than this piece of shit
&gt;&gt;2358644&gt;billions needed to double your investment on ETH&gt;only millions needed to x10 your investment on IOCETH tards when will you learn.
&gt;&gt;2358731Everybody in interested in Ethereum even Putin.Who is interested in IOC?&gt;NobodyBuy Waves and Ethereum!Sasha and Vitalik will rule the world.
&gt;&gt;2358731What the fuck are you talking about
&gt;create bittrex account&gt;can&#039;t even trade crypto to crypto without entering details&gt;enter fake data&gt;&quot;Wait, checking against public records&quot;&gt;some minutes later&gt;&quot;Please contact by phone&quot;How im supposed to buy all those shitcoins that aren&#039;t in poloniex?
You want to make a lot of money anonymously? Why don&#039;t you just sell coke instead?
Use YOBIT. Its a little like seeing a prostitute in terms of how you feel, but there&#039;s no verification whatsoever and they have so many coins that I&#039;m convinced they have made several up.
&gt;&gt;2358642Lol this. Why the fuck don&#039;t you just create a new account with your real ID. If you make any gains you&#039;re still going to have to pay taxes.
&gt;&gt;2358626&gt;&gt;enter fake data
&gt;tfw grandfathered accountBittrex can suck my dick.
&gt;&gt;2358653There&#039;s a difference between deciding when you pay taxes (aka whenever you cash out) vs trusting your data to some exchange probably run by shady russians.
&gt;&gt;2358653&gt;paying taxesAnon I...
&gt;&gt;2358626Yeah I&#039;m real confused by this one too. They don&#039;t even have an option to trade for fiat, so I&#039;m not sure why they&#039;re worried about laundering.
Selling grandfathered accounts for .5btc
&gt;&gt;2358668Where the fuck can you withdraw 10k+ without a bank account? Why are there so many kids on here who are completely oblivious?
&gt;&gt;2358626i never had to enter anything
&gt;&gt;2358693Im not trying to avoid taxes dumbass. I know once I cash out my BTC in 10 years when they are worth millions, i&#039;ll have to pay taxes. But if you don&#039;t leave a trace everywhere you go, you are free to chose WHEN and WHERE you pay taxes.I&#039;ll just cash out and pay any capital gains.
&gt;&gt;2358712Because your acc must be old as fuck.They may demand this data for old accounts randomly so watch out.
&gt;&gt;2358729Yeah watch out, they&#039;ll know your fucking name. Better hide from the Russian hackers.
&gt;&gt;2358626It&#039;s not that hard to get verified. Shit, USD/BTC exchanges are 10x harder to get into
&gt;See DGB is going to have big news in a few weeks&gt;Buy DGB&gt;Sell day before news at what is obviously the peak&gt;Plan to buy back in when it hits the bottomBuy the rumor, sell the news.How the FUCK does /biz/ not understand this very, VERY fundamental principle of investing and trading?Easiest trade I ever did in my life.The time to buy and sell DGB was LAID OUT IN FRONT OF YOU FOR WEEKS. IT WAS SO GODDAMN OBVIOUS. HOW DID ANY OF YOU FUCK UP THE &quot;SELL&quot; PART??This was one of the few opportunities you had to profit off of skill and common sense with little luck involved and most of you fucked it up.
&gt;&gt;2358269Rumors will start to spread after the contest...
&gt;&gt;2358269Because it&#039;s still a gamble, where the news successful it might have blew up even more and you&#039;d lose money if you took out early. Congrats though.
&gt;&gt;2358295What do you mean?Yeah, I&#039;ll buy back in after things cool down.&gt;&gt;2358301I actually left a little bit in in case this happens. I realized that if DGB had actually won the contest or something it would have shot up to like 3500 sats so there is that possibility.But it was basically gambling at that point.
but the volume is still growing like crazy! am i missing something?
&gt;&gt;2358295&gt;He didn&#039;t saw the Digusign presentation of the Citibank T4IChallenge todayYou&#039;re not even aware why is everyone already spelling doom for Digibyte? it was a flaming mess
&gt;&gt;2358269I&#039;ll be honest here. I didn&#039;t do my research and find out where the company was. Assumed it was in Ameri-lands. As you can see I&#039;m here, but a fat lot of good that does right?
&gt;&gt;2358341Contest, not company.
&gt;&gt;2358329The volume growing indicates movement in the market....what you&#039;re missing is that today a bunch of people are selling, not buying.Honestly I&#039;d wait for it to cool off and all the people looking for quick profits take their money away to another coin over the next few days, then I&#039;d buy back in at the bottom of that and hold.It might only be around 1750 or so since that&#039;s where support was last time. But it might be 1600 or even lower so I really think it&#039;s best to wait. Relax, it&#039;s not gonna shoot up 80% overnight or anything for quite a while so you&#039;ve got plenty of time to let the water settle before buying back in.
I&#039;m just saying that as someone who normally just holds and doesn&#039;t day trade....This was an easy, predictable trade that you all should have seen a mile away.Sell the day before big news comes out or as it&#039;s about to come out.Buy in a few days later.This is easy. For anyone uncertain about this, go ask every holder of POTcoin how money they made on 4/20. That was another plain and simple &quot;buy the rumor, sell the news&quot;.
&gt;&gt;2358339&gt;You&#039;re not even aware why is everyone already spelling doom for Digibyte? it was a flaming messFfs, this is exactly what I said.RUMORS!Now look at the price of DGB, buy the dip and thank me later for those damn tasty 15% you will get in a couple of hours when everything cools down and you can sell the stuff you bought at 1850 for 2100.Here, if you want to thank me later for this glorious advise:1CQF625V4t7b8tCLcSbzK4rhmp3L6g1Kyq
&gt;&gt;2358269Day trading is degenerate and I&#039;ve made a lot more money in crypto than you fags by just buying and hodling coins.
&gt;&gt;2358295Yeah rumors that its run by idiots.&gt;&gt;2358355I still have yet to hear what is on the horizon that will cause anyone to buy in.&gt;&gt;2358341&gt;&gt;2358354You seriously should have done your research, the fact that you didnt even know what country it was in tells me you didn&#039;t know anything about it. I did all the resrarch I could on Digibytes and the competition, and it helped immensely.
&gt;&gt;2358398The real digi shoah begins at 1650, not touching it until it rebounds or falls through.
&gt;&gt;2358398Other way around my friend on denial that&#039;s the news, don&#039;t worry i will be sure to send you some chump change since i already pity you
&gt;&gt;2358433&gt;Day trading is degenerate&gt;i CANT MAKE MONEY DOING IT THEREFORE I WILL SPOUT /pol/ BUZZWORDS AT IT
As someone who&#039;s new and hasn&#039;t invested yet I&#039;m glad to learn from this.Thank you OP.
&gt;&gt;2358535My stoploss kicked in at 2020 and Im green. Not even holding DGB right now - but I will buy back in, as soon as it hits 1900 again.
&gt;&gt;2358269&gt;Sell day before news at what is obviously the peakThis is wrong tho.If DGB was announced as clear winner of competition the price would have skyrocketed and you would have lost money.
&gt;&gt;2358511Yep. Ass out of me is how it goes for assuming.
&gt;&gt;2358433I don&#039;t normally day-trade. I buy and hold. But this was just too easy to spot.
I&#039;m doubling up if it hits 1801
&gt;&gt;2358567Yeah but that&#039;s gambling and I have PredictIt for that 50/50 &quot;get rich or lose it all&quot; kind of trading. The whales literally always sell just before big news comes out so it&#039;s best to just follow what they do. But I kept a little bit in just in case.
&gt;&gt;2358567&gt;&gt;2358596That&#039;s why I did research and while everyone on /biz/ reddit and bitcointalk was wondering when the awards would be announced, if they were when aware there would be even be awards, I was ready to sell the minute they announced that the winners. Sure I didn&#039;t sell at 2300, but I got out before the sell off started today
I bought in as 22k. Not selling till 40k.
&gt;&gt;2358570So did you buy?
&gt;&gt;2358656*2.2k
&gt;&gt;2358433&gt;Day trading is degenerateThat&#039;s also the way they talked about my hanging around the high school, but I didn&#039;t let it stop me then, either.
&gt;&gt;2358339If you&#039;re referring to the white background and black text, that was only one slide you idiot
i&#039;ll buy bags at 1300. should be just in time for my transfer to show up in coinbase.
What do you guys think are the most undervalued crypto projects at the moment?My money&#039;s on Aragon, working demo (with really sleek UI), solid and highly responsive Dev team, just broke 100M market cap (so starting to show up on people&#039;s radar), and releasing private beta in October.Thoughts?
&gt;&gt;2356816WHAT IS ANT USED FOR. ELI5
Wings
Buy now or stay poor forever anon, going to 5usd after the weekend.
&gt;&gt;2356829allows a company to run pretty much all of their back-office processes on block chain.faster, cheaper, more secure than existing software.
&gt;&gt;2356816BTC. Should be 10k USD by now.
&gt;&gt;2356816THIS. AND ALSO Ethereum going to boom before btc split in august taking all its ERC20 tokens with it.
PascalCoin for sureMarket cap is only around 10mil and unlike a bunch of the shitcoins with even higher market caps is actually innovative.Guaranteed to be x5 or more by the end of the month
&gt;&gt;2356844i&#039;m looking at this infographic and it says the network gives ant to organzizationss but what do they use it for internally?
&gt;&gt;2356898&gt;2356898
WAVESFactom
&gt;&gt;2356898
I&#039;m a firm believer of monacoin. They got a new tem member a few months ago, and they havent stopped going up since then. I expect it to double up in the next couple of weeks again
Check the weekly/monthly chart for NAUT.It goes wild during the summer.Thoughts?
&gt;&gt;2358294dev is dead
&gt;&gt;2358321aaaaaand I sold my shit
&gt;&gt;2358321Just BK fudding his own coin to get in cheap, Jake Dienelt was never a &quot;dev&quot; just a glorified pumper, NAUT has never had a true developer.You know the script, every summer NAUT pumps mysteriously out of nowhere for weeks, then BK comes and makes a huge announcement promising big new things and it goes higher, then it tanks not long after.It&#039;s seriously the easiest coin to make money off of.
This is gonna double in the next two days. That&#039;s all.
technicals look solid thanks for the tip
200 signatures needed more to let Amazon know that crypto is a good payment method.https://www.change.org/p/jeff-bezos-amazon-com-should-accept-bitcoin-and-litecoin-cryptocurrency-as-payment-methods-asapCrypto needs marketplace accessibility
&gt;implying amazon hasnt already researched the shit out of this
Are there PnD groups out there that will actually get shit done?
not for normie cucks like you. no
&gt;&gt;2357994/biz/ is one
&gt;&gt;2357994I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll regret posting that here but my group is looking for new members after 2 got inactivehttps://discord.gg/qyUjBn

Kgc went from 5 to 7 stats in a couple minutes, better get in, not a group, just /biz/
&gt;&gt;2358064Thanks famalam
&gt;&gt;2358064You&#039;re welcomeWe&#039;re going to do a testpump today to see people are not dumping early.We have 2 highly followed Titteraccounts and some very efficient Reddit shilling strategies, so you have to bring something to the table too, more than shilling on /biz/
&gt;&gt;2358155Meant to quote&gt;&gt;2358113
&gt;&gt;2358155Invite to please, I&#039;m looking for an active group.
&gt;&gt;2358184Look a few posts above you
&gt;&gt;2358191&gt;https://discord.gg/qyUjBnThe invite is expired
&gt;&gt;2358197I actually don&#039;t what that many people since our small size has been the key to our success in the past, but since you asked so nicely:https://discord.gg/TQz5Uy
&gt;&gt;2358215Still active?
&gt;&gt;2358300Seems like it
There are good pump groups out there. They don&#039;t use discord, and they&#039;re not free to the public.
&gt;&gt;2358504We aren&#039;t public eitherWe&#039;re just having an audition atm to get 2-3 more core members
IT IS A GOOD THING THAT DIGIBYTE DID NOT WIN A PRIZE YET.................
&gt;&gt;2358224And it doesn&#039;t even matter if they win this one. If they keep on entering contests eventually they WILL win one or two or three and people will shit themselves and the price will increase a lot. Right now this guys just doing this for recognition/publicity. He&#039;s getting the name out there by entering these contests. That a smart move and it&#039;s how many famous people got recognized.
&gt;&gt;2358224what date is this?
shhhh let it dip some more so we can accumulate a while longer.
They couldn&#039;t win the minor one, yet you think they can win the major one.What kind of retarded logic are you bag holders inventing.You people are truly deluded. You got dumped on. Sell and be done with it.The top advice I got here was don&#039;t get attached to your fucking coins.
They needed to win this one to be in the running for that one.
&gt;&gt;2358325No dickhead, the winners of this one are excluded from the major. This one was basically a peers choice award so really none of the teams wanted to win it.
&gt;&gt;2358326No, try harder faggot
&gt;&gt;2358297literally a few hours ago
&gt;&gt;2358427&gt;the big award is only for those who were too bad to win the small awardslol dat coping logic
How is a $5 million reward even relevant for a coin with a $500 million market cap?
&gt;&gt;2358289this exactlysuccess comes after failures and experience.all this was - was a presentation where a lot of interested technology groups will be watching and observing that look for potential and opportunity
&gt;&gt;2358556STOP WITH YOUR LOGIC! YOU&#039;RE DISTURBING THE COPE-O-SPHERE!
&gt;&gt;2358556The 5 million is for the devs not for us.
&gt;&gt;2358528&gt;tfw too smart to win
Why the fuck would you say that ?Let it dip, buy , profit.

&gt;Hi, my name is Jared and today I will be talking about my science fair project.
&gt;&gt;2356713Could you please share link?
Final winners are chosen in JULY - stop the FUDding LOL
&gt;&gt;2357835how did the presentation go?&gt;&gt;2356713
He reminds me of Jason Genova
&gt;&gt;2358522he put a sticker on his tie like a kindergartner. this guy literally brought DGB to show and tell.
&gt;&gt;2358522Lol fuck you men, now all i can see is that sick ass piss revolting Jason genova. This made me sell all my DGB.
If I was dumb enough to invest in DGB after the pump, I would have pulled out yesterday. All the followers on here are going to be holding bags with this guy at the helm.
Why is it that so many non-Indian crypto devs are still total Pajeets?
&gt;mfw when i bought 10k$ at 300 sats. /CUMFY/
&gt;buy dgb when it was at 600 sats as a LONG TERM INVESTMENT&gt;sold it at 1900 and realizing that all what I knew about dgb - microsoft, gaming, minecraft and all that shit was fake news&gt;feel cheated&gt;don&#039;t know where to put this money now
&gt;&gt;2356963the fudsters aren&#039;t even trying anymore lol
but still i don&#039;t fucking understand why volume is rising constantlydoes whales troling me again?
&gt;&gt;2356963ark
&gt;&gt;2356975You fucked dogs for anus
&gt;&gt;2356963i just did that but from 200 sats to 600, not even fomoing u
what is the REAL gaming coin i should invest to?or i should just wait for IOTA?
&gt;&gt;2357204there will never be a &quot;gaming coin.&quot; it&#039;s a terrible concept.
So is dgb absolutely useless now?
Get into RDD OPRedd ID is coming soonIt will hit 1K alone
&gt;&gt;2357204once valve makes a coin, that&#039;ll be your &quot;gaming coin&quot;otherwise, don&#039;t even think about it
&gt;&gt;2356963&gt;don&#039;t know where to put this money nowANT, wont regret it.
&gt;&gt;2357204if there&#039;s anything worth calling &quot;gaming coin&quot; that&#039;s steem.
Newcomer here. I need some advice.I&#039;ve wagecucked for the past few years and have accumulated $60k. This is my entire savings. I still live at home.I want to double this amount. I&#039;m not looking to go to lamboland or become a millionaire overnight. By over the mext 2 to 3 years I want to have between $100-150k so I can buy a house outright.Can I do this by investing my entire savings in btc and eth? I&#039;m scared of the memecoins and btc and eth seem reliable. But will the price of both reliably double in the next few years?I know no one can read the future, but Im just asking for guidance. Is it worth investing all my money in this market?
&gt;&gt;2358541&gt;Can I do this by investing my entire savings in btc and eth?yes. it really is as simple as that. and doubling your money is an extremely conservative estimate. stay away from shitcoins

dump it in there and forget about it for 5 years and you&#039;ll be rich enough to buy all of Africa
&gt;&gt;2358541I literally doubled my investment in 2 weeks, granted i did follow the golden rule you should never forgetNever put in money you cannot afford to lose, be smart, start with a small sum and see how it pans out before commiting properly
&gt;&gt;2358541Only put in money you&#039;re prepared to lose.BTC could go to 10k or tomorrow some huge exchange might get &quot;hacked&quot; and it all comes crashing down.If you&#039;re fine with potentially losing your 60k then go for it.There&#039;s no such thing as a 100% safe investment.
&gt;&gt;2358625See this is where Im having some issues.I dont know what money I can &quot;afford to lose&quot;. I dont want to lose any money, because if I wagecuck for another 5 years I might be able to afford a house. But if I lose all that money then Ill just be where I am today in 5 years.
&gt;&gt;2358555This. You&#039;ll be able to double your money easily enough over a year or two.If you diversified further, and selected 2-3 of the 5-20 top coins (basically anything with a market cap between $250M and $1B) and invested say 10% of your 60k total (in essence, buy $2-3k of 3 of the lower half of the top 20 coins by market cap), you&#039;d have a more volatile, but more growth-exposed portfolio that would likely net you more money in the long run.If all that&#039;s too complicated though, you could easily just invest in ETH and BTC. Just don&#039;t leave your funds in an online wallet; they are prone to hacks, and just about every major exchange has been hacked at some point (poloniex, bitfinex, and several defunct ones that never recovered from their hacks).Good luck, and happy investing!
&gt;&gt;2358701The closest thing you&#039;ll get to &quot;sure&quot; money is bonds. Everything else has risk.
Who&#039;s ready for the Jupiter mission?Just sold all my DGB and got back on RDD.Shouldn&#039;t have sold at 70 sats, having bought in at 4, but this thing is still going places.
its steady at 100 satready for another moon missionI&#039;m holding til after the Redd ID release though
You can make more on other coins. Sell 30% put that into another crypto.Plenty to pick from. Best to pick a good solid ol school one with a future. Pump coins don&#039;t last.
&gt;&gt;2358106kek did you see the sell walls ?
Sell walls looking like it&#039;s getting ready for another moon mission in a few daysAlways this pattern
&gt;&gt;2358221On RDD or DGB.&gt;&gt;2358199These make up less than 10% of my portfolio.
&gt;&gt;2358106not today my friendfun coin though, you can make small profits constantly just buying 100-102 and sell 103-104
Nevertheless, it is a coin with good technology behind it, if you are interested you can check their websites :)https://www.reddcoin.com/https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/https://www.reddcointalk.org/

They buy shit coins at 1sat, shillings on biz about 10 sat gains, then sell you their bags at 3-4sat. Do not buy higher than 1sat, you will lose money.
&gt;&gt;2355532They said the same thing about HTML5, RDD, MOON, etc.HTML5 literally had a 51% attack and it increased 9x in price. Have you even researched this coin and its benefits?
Can we break the 2 sat wall?

I was SO close to actually getting in on it before i scrolled down and saw their lead developerThe people a company employs says a lot about it
&gt;&gt;2356936&gt; im more interested in mens aesthetics than making moneymaybe homocoin is a better fit for you
&gt;&gt;2356894Bought in OP. thanks for the head&#039;s up senpai.
&gt;&gt;2356936Good devs are always eccentrics. Combine that with the asian CEO and the asian full stack dev, it&#039;s confirmed you are a fucking retard.&gt;gambling&gt;sports&gt;normie&gt;impossible to fail
&gt;&gt;2356894Thank you senpai, I hope you&#039;re right

https://github.com/wagerr/wagerr
They had no whitepaper until the ICO started. It got propped up within days. It&#039;s all a bunch of bullshit.I bet the OP is getting paid to shill this. Just think, why in the world would you give these fucks your money? There are MUCH more promising projects.

&gt;&gt;2357698&gt;https://github.com/wagerr/wagerrHe&#039;s a coder, he&#039;s not going into a bloody showing to sell anything. Look at Jason, he had a presentation that looked like it was made by a 12 year old, poor body language, no proper suit and tie, and people are still shilling the living shit out of DGB.Expecting a coder to look like a businessman? I don&#039;t know what else to say... personally, if I saw a coder dressed in a suit, I wouldn&#039;t go near that company because it looks more like a scam made by a couple of rich entrepreneurs.
Meant @2358162
&gt;&gt;2358073Of what? How can you not see how low quality this cash grab is?People in cryptocurrencies are so gullible. That and there&#039;s a lot of retards buying into anything thinking they&#039;ll always find a bigger retard to sell to.
Or whatever that clowns name was... Jared.If this turns out being a scam, I couldn&#039;t care less either. I only put a few k into it... but if it is real (which I think it is), the return will be crazy.
&gt;&gt;2356908&gt;Running a Node on this shit will be so profitableHow much coins would I need for a node; do we know that already? Can a node be run on a Synology NAS?You say profitable - if we assume that it moons to $0.5, what is your prediction for how much cash/WGR a node will generate a day?Sorry if those are noobie questions, I&#039;m new to this, but OP successfully sold this to me and i might as well go in 100%.
As for the missing GitHub:&quot;The decision to not release any code has been taken by the CEO David. The reasoning for it is that there are competitors who are trying to take advantage since wagerr is the first mover in this market.There has been development ongoing for the past 8 month and also a wallet demo on the 15th. There are 2 active devs on the team and we are hiring another next week. I would advise anyone who wants to know more to join the slack where the team are very good at answering any questions you may have... https://slack.wagerr.com/&quot;
And here&#039;s the dev team:https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mah-3ba983143/https://www.linkedin.com/in/wagerrx/https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnchoi11/https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-mclaughlin-70a39578/https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/22301268/https://www.linkedin.com/in/jm-maradiaga-95a988141/
&gt;&gt;2357729the code is private atmdemo on 15th, code will be released laterbut whatevs im just a shil... so do whatever you want with this info&gt;&gt;2358162people are fucking retarded if they miss out on this based what the devs look like
that&#039;s a shit project which makes no sense. they just want to scoop up some ico money.
&gt;&gt;2358426&gt;people are fucking retarded if they miss out on this based what the devs look likeI know. /biz/logic
&gt;&gt;2358426&gt;&gt;2358617Can you paid shills get out? /biz/ doesn&#039;t have too much money anyways, better off trying to sell this scam elsewhere.
Does this coin has the potential to rerach 1usd?
&gt;&gt;2356804no0.01 maybe
&gt;&gt;2356804YES
yeah its gonna make it
This is not the next eth but it should two or threefold in the next two weeks. The amount of coins is to high to reach 1 usd anytime soon. If this should moon really hard expect it to reach dgb prices, on the long run maybe xrp level.
&gt;&gt;2356804Wouldn&#039;t that mean the market cap has to go up to at least $13 billion for that to happen? I don&#039;t know if that will happen any time soon.
&gt;&gt;2356967&gt;$13B market capFat fucking chance
&gt;&gt;2358324If this reaches DGB or XRP levels I would be super happy. I would sell immediately and cash out of crypto.
I bet it&#039;ll be around 500 in a month or two
&gt;&gt;2356804&gt;some biz tard shilled this at 5 sats weeks before moon and no one listenedStay poor bro.
&gt;&gt;2358438I had already bought 100k before the moon. Now I will hold until 1$. This coin never disapointed me.Stay poor yourself lad
Set yourself up with Vertcoin this weekend. This is getting pumped AF.

&gt;&gt;2358407they went over their own cap this ico is bullshit
&gt;&gt;2358407Will buy on the exchanges thanks OP. Aeternity is a solid project but it&#039;s one you&#039;d want to buy after ICO given the circumstances.
&gt;&gt;2358407&gt;I&#039;ve already used my eth $5000 daily limit withdrawal on kraken, wont let me withdraw another $5000 for another dayreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

&gt;&gt;2358414I think it&#039;s a soft cap where you get a grace period at the end.
&gt;&gt;2358471Uh they have a test net ready which was developed in a functional programming language ErLang and the mainnet is going to be ready by the end of this year. They are unique enough unlike recently overhyped stratis which doesn&#039;t even have a functional wallet lul.
Oh hey Anon! So I saw an article yesterday and B-Bitcoin? Is that what they call it? Was like over $2500 now.I saw you mention it before, you must be a rich guy now! Hey, wanna go out with us sometime and have a drink?
&gt;&gt;2358551Just tell them you bought a single bitcoin and you might sell it soon just cause YOLO; Tell them it&#039;s probably just some bullshit hacker money
PSA for nufags who actually want to make money. /biz/ is literally only comprised of poorfags shilling the worst of the worse. Not one of these losers is worth a damn. Watch this btc wallet.

Sometimes it&#039;s fun getting in the PnDs. I got in mooncoin when it was first being shilled for 1sat, sold it a few hours later for double.
&gt;&gt;2357528It&#039;s pretty much taken over at this point. /biz/ is mostly shit because of this.
newfag reporting in. thanks, op. /biz/ can be hard to navigate.
&gt;&gt;2357551The newfags/shillers are obvious, it&#039;s easy to ignore them.

&gt;&gt;2357447Where can I invest in Stance Coin?
&gt;&gt;2358026What is stance coin?
Middle class wage cuck here.I like /biz but you guys need to stop shilling shitcoins. Half the threads are about pumping and day trading virtual garbage.
OP is correct. This board is full of poor college kids and neets spending their birthday money. I&#039;ve yet to see evidence of anyone who has actually gotten rich here.&lt;-----proof
&gt;&gt;2358175Yeah I was saying this earlier - we should get a virtuous circle of research and tips for winning bets off of good research.Instead we&#039;ve got people screwing one another and it&#039;s increasingly like searching for tiny pieces of gold in a kiddies&#039; paddling pool of fecal matter.I like it here though so people should just remorselessly pound the shills.
&gt;&gt;2358284It&#039;s getting to be impossible because we&#039;re overrun with kiddie idiots playing with mommy and daddy&#039;s money. If anyone here had any real money we wouldn&#039;t see people so willing to throw it into scams.
&gt;&gt;2358342&gt;when the levee breaks&gt;mama you gotta move
&gt;&gt;2358342I work as a consultant and toss around 30k into various shitcoins. I&#039;ve tripled my money in 2 months here.What the fuck are you talking about? I think you&#039;re clueless how much money we actually make from this board.
&gt;&gt;2358342and thats why this thread exists, share your wisdom with us lesser cretins
&gt;&gt;2358365This is true. Every once and a while I find a good thread but it&#039;s worse everyday. I might migrate for a while.
&gt;&gt;2358411&gt;30k&gt;rich&gt;welcome to /biz/

&gt;&gt;2358503That&#039;s not what he said you dumb cunt
&gt;&gt;2358560&gt;providing zero evidence that anyone on /biz/ has gotten rich&gt;not realizing that the market cap on cryptos has more than tripled in the time period he&#039;s referring to

Have you ever told anyone about your crypto holdings or earnings?I don&#039;t mean coming out and saying that you have 1000 ETH, but has the cryptocurrency ever come up in conversation and you absentmindedly admitted that you had some valuable crypto?Recently, I was at the bar and I discovered that one of my friends had an interest in crypto, so we struck up a conversation on it. Eventually, when my guard was down, she asked how much crypto I had. Instinctively, I told her that I had a couple ETH (I have more than just two ETH, and am stockpiling other coins).I realized my mistake when her jaw dropped at this mention. I sheepishly corrected myself by saying, &quot;Well, more like 1.73 ETH.&quot; Still, I felt like I had just dodged a bullet. She admitted that she had only put around $100 into BTC and was thinking about diversifying into Monero and Ripple, so I see why she was surprised to hear about my holdings.Have you accidentally ever told anyone about your earnings? If so, did it change their opinion of you or did they try to guilt you into giving them money?
I&#039;ve told my best friend but I don&#039;t think he even cares
I never talk about earnings and never talk about crypto to normies. Ever. Keep it to yourself. If someone knows about crypto, I only talk about where prices are going, never about how much I hold. Except shillcoins and bags of course.It can ONLY hurt you to talk about crypto too much.
&gt;&gt;2354052&gt;has $100 in BTC&gt;somehow shocked at you having ~$500 in ETH, only 5x more than her investment&gt;this scares you so much you feel like you &quot;dodged a bullet&quot; (???)
&gt;&gt;2354052&gt;shenice larping anon
I told someone at work the other day I could make more money trading magic beans on the internet.
&gt;&gt;2354111Uh, yeah, I could have told her that I have tens of thousands. I don&#039;t know how she would have handled that given her reaction to a mere $500.
&gt;things that never happened: the threadop is a fag
I told me dad I got in on ETH at around $120 and put in $5k. He gave me a high five so that was pretty cool
hookers seem to know about crypto...
i had to talk to someone and i had nothing else going on in my life so i brought it up
&gt;&gt;2354135You&#039;re making me want to hodl my beans, and I have sell orders active.
I told my best friend about ETH at $18.He blindly took my advice and used $900 out of his sports betting bankroll... cashed out into BTC then converted to ETH and has sat on it ever since.He&#039;s sitting on $13,000 right now. He says if we make it to $500, he&#039;s taking me to vegas.Feels good man
&gt;&gt;2354094&gt;Keep it to yourself. If someone knows about crypto, I only talk about where prices are going, never about how much I hold.Yeah, but someone asking about how much you have is such a natural segway from a typical crypto conversation. It&#039;s almost difficult NOT to ask. Which is why I have &quot;I have a couple&quot; on speed dial. If I say I don&#039;t have any, yet display an avid interest in the subject, it would likely come across as a lie. Too bad I like talking about crypto so much.&gt;&gt;2354120&gt;&gt;2354146Not everyone on 4chinz is a shut-in.&gt;&gt;2354158Heh, my dad still thinks I&#039;m investing into a ponzi scheme.&gt;&gt;2354135Subtle, I like it.&gt;&gt;2354173Damn, and to think I don&#039;t have any friends like that.
&gt;&gt;2354052&gt;at the bar&gt;friends&gt;herlmaothe thought of you sitting there typing that bullshit made me laughthx bae
&gt;&gt;2354214Nice meme, reddit.
My friend gave me a grand and I turned it into $40k, but he&#039;s the only one I really talk to about it and where I realistically see it heading, well him and a cunt I&#039;m gonna fug just so she pretend to be interested in me for me when she really just wants those crypto earnings
If someone is envious at having a few thousand dollars, you should probably just dump them. They could end up ruining your life. I&#039;m just going to tell people I&#039;m jobless and a gambling addict.
&gt;&gt;2354052&gt;brag to everyone about my gains&gt;never give any to friends or family&gt;tfw wish I had friends or family
&gt;&gt;2354052I&#039;m with this guy&gt;&gt;2354111You sound like a retard.
&gt;&gt;2354484Do you have a 3rd grade reading level?
&gt;&gt;2354052I do, but to be fair its not as if I have anything worth bragging about
&gt;&gt;2354052Normie outtt ouutt ouuuuuuuttttttt
i do talk about it but as a leggit poorfag, i say &quot;but i&#039;m poor so i didn&#039;t really invest much.&quot;
&gt;&gt;2354120heh
&gt;&gt;2354111what is toast?
Told some people back in the day when I was holding 6 or so. Now that it&#039;s at ATH and it&#039;s apparently in the news or something, I&#039;m being asked about it again. Too bad I didn&#039;t know about the don&#039;t-tell-anyone /biz/ meme back then.
I TOLD A TRAP HOOKER THAT HER PENIS LOOKED MY 10 ETH COINSA ROCK SOLID INVESTMENT
&gt;&gt;2354052nobody here knows cryptonot even the rich ones
I just charge normies $50. Helped someone start a coinbase, MEW, and basic trading on Bittrex.That $50 went to ARK
&gt;&gt;2354172I stopped holding beans after I doubled my money and then lost half. It&#039;s just a convenient thing to tell normies without going in to words they don&#039;t understand.
&gt;&gt;2354052&gt;2 ETH is a lot of moneyWhere do you live? Zimbabwe?
Dont tell anyone about your crypto or your gains.People are shit, they&#039;ll snitch on you and the IRS will be on your ass.
&gt;&gt;2358436This. OP is either dirt poor or 12 years old.2 ETH is like a day or 2&#039;s pay at my job.
&gt;&gt;2354135&gt;I told someone at work the other day I could make more money trading magic beans on the internet.Yes, when around normies talk about Crypto like metaphors in a story.&gt;ohhh I just bought some Bitty Beans online and now I&#039;ve got enough beans on that beanstalk to take me to the moon! Hahahaha!Normies gobble that shit up like emoji decorated icing on a muffin.
&gt;&gt;2354052&gt;Her jaw dropped when she found out I had $500you guys probably paid over $50 for your shitty drinks
OP how fucking poor are you that 2 ETH is considered a lot?
You&#039;re going to regret it if you don&#039;t.
&gt;&gt;2356909My nigga

&gt;&gt;2356977I&#039;m glad you&#039;re there, scamnon. In a world full of chaos, your presence in every thread leaves me at ease. At least you&#039;ll always be there for us.
&gt;&gt;2356909mooning imminent
Hey Onee-san, look, I wonder if its possible that LBRY.io may end up saving humanity from itself.#FreedomOfSpeech #Decentralisation
no. just buy DGB you fucking retard. It&#039;s going up to a dollar you can make 20x your money in under 5 months. Stop flooding biz with these retarded shit posts about shit coins.
&gt;&gt;2355878Oh dear,Well, the LBRY is growing slowly and steadily, as a high value coin. So, we never needed pump and dump kids to come inside, only those who enjoy being comfy.
&gt;&gt;2355954Can you tell me about the coin anon
ITT: we laugh at normies
&gt;tfw learned from PoSW to not make the same mistake with DigibyteRemember when there was nothing but hype leading up to the dividends payout? Remember when the price climbed to unsustainable levels? Remember what happened when the news passed and was disappointing, despite all the &quot;tech&quot; behind it?Yeah, well glad I didn&#039;t make that mistake again.
thread theme:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwS66EBUcYNeed HEROES to hold my bags
&gt;&gt;2357669SWEDENYES
&gt;&gt;2357680the REAL thread theme:https://vimeo.com/217855365I wish i had some bit bean but i don&#039;t have the beans to hold such a masculine currency
oh fuck I forgot to add LBRY
Honestly I fucking hate myself for posw.It was like they used an ICO as a kickstarter without providing any proof of concepts or even fucking drawings.It&#039;s a fucking harddrive that has a laser engraved case, not that fucking hard!They delisted bitbean and took their gains. FUCK THEM
Why is watching shitcoins crash and burn so entertaining bros? DGB holders are easily the most obnoxious cunts /biz/ has had to deal with for a long time, pretty satisfying to see them lose gains.
&gt;&gt;2357705&gt;tfw I accumulated 4m bitbean because I love collecting them for my PoSW gains and didn&#039;t care about gains&gt;sold it anyway during the peakkek wills it
&gt;&gt;2357733schadenfreude
&gt;&gt;2357615What is the point of this thread?I made a 300% profit on digibyte, a 50% profit with mooncoin and massive profit after buying espers with my POSWIs this thread just for people who are mad they missed the boat? It&#039;s like making a thread mocking ETH just because it isn&#039;t mooning right this second.
&gt;&gt;2357743I&#039;ve never bought any meme coins because i&#039;m a fag and retarded. pray for me and my meagre earning
&gt;&gt;2357733?????????????????Literally, everybody I know in DGB is way up including myself. Who the fuck is losing on this ride?
&gt;&gt;2357615&gt;tfw using DGB gains to buy more STRATcan&#039;t wait for that to hit $50-$100
&gt;&gt;2357805Good if you&#039;re into long term hold.
Buy SWT, you dumb niggers.
&gt;&gt;2357615You take pride in being autistic?
&gt;&gt;2357615why the fuck is bitbean there?all the true beaners got in at 30 sats (same time we got in on posw RIP)it&#039;s still at 220 satsbitbean is still flying high you have no right to associate it with those loser coins, it still can break out and go higher to flip the doge
&gt;&gt;2357793literally this. I made 500%, what&#039;s the matter.
&gt;&gt;2357733did DGB crash?what happened?
&gt;&gt;2358203mooncoin is also 10 sat, even though it was 1 sat when it started to be shilled here, 10x gains is not something to laugh about
https://youtu.be/w9bfEB_fXvMFox Alice- take into account Pinocchio - the doctrine does not bring anyone to the good.In the Land of Fools there is a magic field called the Field of Miracles ... In this field, dig a hole, say three times: &quot;Kreks, fakes, pecs&quot;, put it in a hole of gold, fill it with earth, sprinkle salt on top, and have a good bed and go to sleep. The next morning a small tree will grow from the hole, on it instead of leaves gold coins will hang.
Why&#039;s this pumping randomly?Already had 1500 for longterm hold, but blockfolio alert going ham.
Make sure you&#039;re out before the Whales dump, gonna have a hard correction soon
&gt;&gt;2358492Not getting out for ages, they haven&#039;t even had a whitepaper yet.
New wallet is being released soon
Seriously, I thought this was just a PND scam but there is insane volume/sell walls.
&gt;&gt;2357025The developer of this coin fucked a dog
Many people are working on it now but there&#039;s a few large holders from early in the year trying to make money by moving the price around.They let it get up to 10 then slam it down to 6 hoping weak hands will sell out.
&gt;&gt;2357032Moon will skyrocket anytime soon, get in the rocket while u can
Soooooonnnnn..... trex is coming
Literally who knows, we&#039;re just starting
&gt;early in the yeari.e. 2 weeks ago when the PnD began
&gt;&gt;2357583Nah back in feb someone tried to buy it all up and PnD. They failed after a few days and volume collapsed. Probably just burned through money pushing the volume.
&gt;&gt;2357025This coin is gonna make me so much fucking money. 20million at 1 sat. Every 5 sats my stack goes up a btc. I&#039;ll start selling half once it gets over 100.
&gt;&gt;2357025People finally realized Moon has real potential.It&#039;s refueling now before launching above 10.
&gt;&gt;2358058How do we know it&#039;s not tanking?
&gt;&gt;2358058IT HAD NO POTENTIAL FOR 3 YEARS NOW.it will not!
&gt;&gt;2358120Look at 500 BTC buying orders and that is only bleutrade. If it hits other exchanges it would be even more.
&gt;&gt;2358145It has new dev team.
&gt;&gt;2357791I&#039;m about same as you senpai, a bit less at 14 mil. When are you planning to sell?&gt;&gt;2357025You don&#039;t seem to know what&#039;s going behind the curtains, there are a lot of people working on this coin right now to legitimately revive it and make it successful again, not sure why this coin exactly since there are plenty of &gt;10sat coins, but it is what it is.
&gt;&gt;2357025Its not a PnD. It actually has huge potential, especially once the new services they are working on come out. Whales keep pushing the price down to kick out the weak hands. Honestly I think this is fine as it is a process of natural selection; soon the only ones left are the ones who wont sell and the price will hit 1k satoshis.
&gt;&gt;2358223I wish...
&gt;&gt;2358223&gt;1k sat MOONHave you seen MOON&#039;s supply?You realise that would be a $6bn market cap?i.e. worth more than DASH, LTC, ETC, STRAT and XMR combinedFuck off shill
&gt;&gt;2358170It really depends how it plays out. Holding til 100 at least then I might sell off half.
&gt;&gt;2358419&gt;100sat&gt;MOON could be worth more than WAVESenough of the memes, pls
&gt;&gt;2358170&gt;You don&#039;t seem to know what&#039;s going behind the curtains, there are a lot of people working on this coin right now to legitimately revive it and make it successful again, not sure why this coin exactly since there are plenty of &gt;10sat coins, but it is what it is.The name is good, easy to pronounce in many languages, simple object that can be visualized, has an amusement factor due to the &quot;to the moon!&quot; joke. The biggest downside is the whale that holds billions of coins, market cap will likely limit it to 20-50 sat maybe 100 if lucky.
&gt;&gt;2357025&gt;&gt;2357086&gt;&gt;2357312&gt;&gt;2358401&gt;&gt;2358483Full Moon tonight friends, let us rejoice in the coin.
&gt;&gt;23584011k is a stretch, but If were talking a year from now, obv DASH LTC STRAT will prob all be worth 5x what they are now at least. Bitbean is 100 sats right now with similar supply.
In Australia, what happens if you can&#039;t pay back paypal/they can&#039;t take money out of your account?
&gt;&gt;2357658Debt collectors come knocking at your door
&gt;&gt;2357819How long til they put debt collectors on you? Can you make payment arrangements with paypal?
&gt;&gt;2357914what happened, anon?
I can see some of you hopped on the Netko train, this is going straight into top 100 on coinmarketcap, means crazy gainsOnly 2 million coins around means a SUPERLOW market cap and lots of room to grow, add to that an active developement team and you will get why i am pushing you all to purchase itIt basically has no sell wall, not even 1btc is separating us from 8400 sats to 10ksats where we are heading, and it will continue to grow steadilySoon to be on novaexchange but for nowhttps://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=NETKO_BTCHave i not persuaded you faggots_ When i first posted this it was at 3k sats and look at it nowYou can choose to actually earn money or keep playing with shitcoins like KIDS MAD RUBYCOIN LITEDOGE MOON or whatever whales will dump on you
&gt;&gt;2357075Scam the developer is a wanted man.
Need to see proof regarding your statementOtherwise you are clearly trying to get it cheaper before it moons
Stop posting about this you little shit.
Not my fault you dont like money you autistic fuckKeep rolling yourself in shitcoins living in your mother&#039;s basement while a few clever people saw this coming weeks before whalesOnce whales get in there is no stopping, only big wall is at 100k sats
Steady at 8400 sats while preparing for a bigger jumpIt already multiplied x2 in the latest daysDont believe me check the paper thin sell wallsCant believe you guys fell for Rubycoin and for Mooncoin and refuse to purchase Netko
Alright anons time for another Yobit Shitcoin Adventure, this time check out KGC, these walls are almost non existant, 1 btc will get us past well over 30. Get in early before the pajeets at Yobit catch wind
5 sats seems like a lot to start out at
Literally pumped 2 mins ago, fuck of cigany
&gt;&gt;2357930Well you just missed your chance at 5 sats, it&#039;s 6 sats now and there&#039;s some buy support
&gt;&gt;2357959It&#039;s pumping right now, just jumped up to 7 sats, now only 8 left
8 sat almost out
&gt;buying into one of these meme coins at anything other than 1satlel
&gt;&gt;2358281This, anything more than 1 has a pajeet behind
&gt;&gt;2358281I don&#039;t know man, buy support has been increasing dramatically, I got in at 6 and I&#039;m probably gonna try to get 3x gains
Anyone gonna buy that last bit of 7 sat before it&#039;s gone?
&gt;&gt;2358378Just sell while you&#039;re ahead. It won&#039;t keep on growing, you&#039;re literally just pumping and dumping it on one another. OP is already out I can guarantee you this.
&gt;&gt;2358281&gt;&gt;23583082 satoshi are pretty low-risk as well (you can easily break even)3 and above is a no-no
What the fuck is actually happened to ZenCash?I thought that coin was like Zcash but better, I&#039;ve read nothing but positive opinions.
pls respond
i think one of the developers left and sold his coins. Im still hodling because i think it will recover.
&gt;&gt;2357621goddamnit, I&#039;m hodling too.bought this shit at 60000
Lead dev (who apparently was the only dev) left and went back to ZCL. The whole situation is a mess.
This is actually really good news guys. Pick some up while it&#039;s this fudding cheap!
&gt;&gt;2358235FUDers gonna FUD
&gt;&gt;2358235STOP SHILLING FOR THIS SCAM COIN
d-dont get weak hands just y-yet guys... we can recover
clank?
&gt;&gt;2358459Only one coin to invest in now...
&gt;&gt;2358469and it ain&#039;t a fucking bean
It&#039;s going to pump!!! read the charts now!
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US EARLIER FAGGOTKYS
@Anonymous be grateful bitch
its dipping you faggot
I guess you don&#039;t know a shit about trading.Wait some hours and see by yourself.
At first I thought the ransomware attack was to associate BTC with terrorism but maybe they just wanted to give banks justification for accumulating BTC.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-06-08/jim-cramer-goes-batty-bitcoin-may-hit-1000000-act-now-its-too-late
Never post about the ransomware attacks when you&#039;re complete ignorant about them.They have existed ever since BTC got any attention at all. Even when it was only a couple hundred dollars. In fact, I very vividly remember the original ransom being 5 BTC exactly despite the changing price.
&gt;&gt;2357971OK wise one - tell us the nature and purpose of the ransomware atttacks then.Are intel agencies behind them or private groups?Why didnt they ask for more than just $300 in BTC?
&gt;&gt;2358012You&#039;re a brainlet, stay away from the deeper questions..Cross analysis clearly isn&#039;t your strong point
&gt;&gt;2358012What are you on about?Do you have any knowledge of malware? It&#039;s not as complicated as you&#039;re making it out to be.Ransomware is making a comeback recently due to fake AV being a major fail, nobody falls for it. So, ransomware is a lot more effective at outright scaring people into giving them money.They ask for BTC for obvious reasons. It&#039;s that simple. There is no government plot or Jewish schemes.
&gt;&gt;2358012&gt;tell us the nature and purpose of the ransomware atttacks then.to make money?
&gt;&gt;2358030&gt;&gt;2358041&gt;&gt;2358060Uh the banksters do pull shit like this. BTC could very well be a threat to them or given that a paper about crypto was released with the permission of the NSA in 1996, it might be their pet project.I don&#039;t pretend to be so sure about things.http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm
&gt;&gt;2358012&gt;Why didnt they ask for more than just $300 in BTC?Because its likely some malware that was designed with normal users in mind. You want it to be affordable to pay. It wasn&#039;t targeted at the UK&#039;s health system particularly, someone there just fucked up and got the system infected.
&gt;&gt;2358082&gt;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htmYou&#039;re an absolute idiot that apparently didn&#039;t even read their own link. That is simply a report on digital currency which was already out at the time. Did you think bitcoin was the first digital currency or something?
&gt;&gt;2358082Is that link supposed to prove the ebin banksters are planning precise attacks against citizens of dozens of countries around the world in order to gain control over cryptocurrency? See how absurd that sounds?&gt;&gt;2358104This is correct. Cryptolocker/Crilock (which was around late 2013/early 2014) was purely aimed at civilians.They asked for either BTC or moneypak which you can get information on via a google search. Pretty sure the latter isn&#039;t asked for anymore because moneypak found some way to avoid it being used as ransom or it got into legal trouble.Sure does sound like the bankers, doesn&#039;t it? I&#039;ve been researching and combating malware since early 2000s and although things have gotten a little quiet, I still keep up with all of these new ransomware threats that are constantly out there. OP and this guy have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.
&gt;&gt;2358041I know about malware.The point is plausible deniability - this is how the intel agencies/elites/bankers operate - via proxies that are plausible - &quot;terrorist groups&quot;
&gt;&gt;2358153an analogy would be having ISIS attack multiple countries to install police states - not that far-fetched.
&gt;&gt;2357954&gt;zerohedgeFfs, stop reading this shit.They have as much experience and expertise as the average /pol/ - idiot.
&gt;&gt;2358154This recent attack was based in Russia, right? What exactly do you think is cooperating with these people in order to frame BTC as some sort of terrorist currency?On the other hand, why do you think they are using it in order to accumulate? Do you mean they wish to give it public understanding and ramp up the price?You need a little bit more to back it up than what you have currently. People have said what you are saying previously, but it never leads into anything.It&#039;s not really /biz/ related until you can give some actual clues, or better yet, evidence. Even then, it&#039;s a little more /pol/ related.
&gt;&gt;2358190My point is to keep an open mind as new narratives are floated into the media.Of course the story about these being an independent group of cyberattackers is on the list. But seeing as they are trying to blame Russia for everything wrong in the world, the story at its face-value seems unlikely. Can&#039;t good hackers cover their tracks, or make it seem like an attack is coming from one particular country when it isn&#039;t?
&gt;&gt;2358255The latest attack that you heard on the news was actually a major fail. I&#039;m rather surprised at how much damage it caused considering the absolute ineptitude by the group to spread it effectively.The IT at that hospital were also completely inept at their job. Useless IT guys are the reason why the attack caused any amount of wealth in damage at all.So these guys really weren&#039;t &quot;good hackers&quot;. The person who develops the ransomware and encryption is one guy, but the people who actually control the attacks must have been a little clueless.I just wonder why bankers or the CIA or NSA would have any connection to these random guys in the middle of nowhere that completely failed a worldwide ransomware attack.
&gt;&gt;2358318Failure itself isn&#039;t evidence that intel wasn&#039;t behind it.&gt;I just wonder why bankers or the CIA or NSA would have any connection to these random guys in the middle of nowhereSame thing could be said about ISIS, Mujahadeen, etc...They may not want to actually disrupt things, only give BTC a bad name and scare people out of it or provide justification for cracking down on it and for the banks to hold it. Who knows - maybe banks have already accumulated.I&#039;m sure people in this thread are much more expert on malware than I am but when you know how the world really works, especially when it comes to money, we should not be attached to one position or take anything we see on the media at face valueAnyway, the whole bs premise just stuck out like a sore thumb as an attempt to create plausible deniability.Time will tell. Anyway, yes I acknowledge I&#039;m speculating. I didn&#039;t pretend to be doing anything else. Wanted to get some input.
&gt;Stopped taking advice from the noobs screeching &#039;to the moon&#039; every 5 minutes on Biz&gt;Actually started to make gainsFuck of shills
&gt;&gt;2358356Anyone with a few functioning brain cells should learn that chasing the pump &amp; dump shit the established discord fags arrange is ruinous.The only reliable way to make money is to buy in early, or at a significant enough discount to mitigate risk and volatility.
&gt;&gt;2358440My only regret is not getting into Waves when it was dirty cheap
Based on your calculations, which one will crash first?
&gt;&gt;2355721My supercomputer has calculated 100% chance of Eth crashing and 0% chance of Bitcoin crashing.
&gt;&gt;2355726Eth is a scam
They seem to be trying really hard to crash BTC, by the way they&#039;re acting. It&#039;s still there though. Being first has it&#039;s perks.
&gt;&gt;2355755low quality fud&gt;&gt;2355726high quality fud
Why does everything needs to crash?
I just had a dream where eth was at 350
They copy each other. Both crash and rise in tandem.
&gt;&gt;2355721On August 1st, BTC will have a huge &quot;correction&quot;, money will pour into ETH, LTC and XMR.You better screen cap this shit
&gt;&gt;2356296Was about to say this. Anon is not joking. Read about BIP 148.tl;dr - Bitcoin will either have a soft fork (to activate segwit, bigger blocks in order to scale the tech) or bitcoin will be divided into &quot;old&quot; bitcoin (the one you use now) and a new chain. Very dark times will be ahead of us. If I was you, I&#039;d go 100% to alts or I wouldn&#039;t trade Bitcoin prior to the 1st up until shit calms down (1 week - 1 month)MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THEM ON A COLD WALLET
&gt;&gt;2356333I&#039;ve been holding bitcoin since 2012, sold half for ETH in September last year. Over the last couple of months I&#039;ve put some of my remaining BTC into ICOs, but yesterday I put the rest into ETH, because I don&#039;t want to get fucked over by a possible fork.If Bitcoin gets its shit together I might buy back in, but for now I&#039;m steering clear.
&gt;&gt;2355721here is my calculations:https://pastebin.com/HaUFmW0f
Lol @ 50% when the bar is at 75%
&gt;&gt;235642966%
&gt;&gt;2356333I would yank everything out of exchanges too. When shit gets volitile they&#039;ll be a run on the exchange like a run on the banks. Those without capital will fail
&gt;&gt;2356450yea I fucked that up
&gt;&gt;2356420&gt;&gt;2356451Totally agree with you guys. I think I&#039;m going on the XMR ETH and maybe XRP boat. XMR has held its value, even grown, even without an ICO or anything. They went up like bitcoin went up - because people actually wanted to buy it.
&gt;&gt;2355721ETH is in the same spot btc was the first time it got into triple digits.All hype, no substanceIt will crash and take much of the alt market with it. I don&#039;t no know when, but that&#039;s how it&#039;s going down.Bonus points for Lord vitalik coming up with some more crazy centralization memes to hold on to his wealth
&gt;&gt;2356333I read that the soft fork will take months to finish if it&#039;s done (the rest of the year) and that bitcoiners can&#039;t sell/buy coins during it or else they risk losing them.
&gt;&gt;2357256I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be months. If the Soft Fork goes as the community expects it to go, and there&#039;s not a split in the chain, we&#039;ll be back in business in no time. If the chain split does happen, then yes, it may take a while. But months? I doubt it.
&gt;&gt;2356296or maybe BTC will crash and bring ETH down with him
&gt;&gt;2355721ETH moves in lock-step with BTC, just look at the fucking charts for the last two dips. Like a 0.99 correlation.
&gt;&gt;2355721&gt;ETH&gt;crashingPick only one
Isnt the question when the crash will happen? Not if?We cant keep making record gains forever. The party will be over eventually.
&gt;&gt;2357558Yeah, you doubt it. That&#039;s why all the problems bitcoin had in the past were solved in two days.
&gt;&gt;2358403This is true
PTC PUMP N DUMP LOL
What&#039;s the real difference between scammy pajeet coins on YoBit and seemingly reputable giants like DGB?Both are pumps &amp; dumps, just on different levels
HOW IS DGB A PnD? A PRIVATE MINECRAFT SERVER IS AMAZING TECH REEEEEEEEEH
It&#039;s just different levels of risk. Everyone knows with yoshit coins are a ponzi but it can be worth it.I blame trumpcoin for them being here desu. Thats when many pajeets learned about biz.
&gt;&gt;2357432IDK how dgb is p&amp;d considering the market capNot shilling dgb I just don&#039;t get it, do people think there are billionaires looking to buy shitcoins on biz? Now with a coin like Ruby I can see the room to grow that you&#039;d want for a pump or even a long term, but where do people think Digibyte is going to be in the next year? It&#039;s clearly not the next BTC eth or strat at this point ?
&gt;&gt;2357703It&#039;s all based on long held opinions before the price shot up. Just like many hate XRP.
&gt;&gt;2357716So do people think xrp and Digi are going to grow or did they not think that far ahead?
&gt;&gt;2357726I&#039;m not sure. They&#039;re probably thinking that wasn&#039;t supposed to happen because DGB is a shitcoin pnd and XRP is not a crypto
&gt;&gt;2357766DGB is a shitcoinIt&#039;s going to get dumpeddumbass bagholders are trying to cope
&gt;&gt;2357716For fuck sakes this board is stupid. Any coin that hasn&#039;t had natural market growth without a strong market influencing platform is bound to be pumped and dumped. Compare that to a coin like VTC. Difficult to mine, and the market doesn&#039;t have a ton available. DGB on the other hand uses SHA, which everyone has a fucking ASIC for, allowing mass production over time, and the market was flooded with cheap coins. Tons of DGB is out there. XRP obviously has a massive supply of coins, so the accumulation was possible for a while too. Then with all that and the recent bump of bitcoin, we see a perfect storm taking advantage, shills and pumpers trying to call attention to these coins and drive the price up so they can safely sell their massive quantities and make major bank. This is simple stuff. You&#039;re dealing with unregulated markets with a seemingly endless number of coins with different platforms that have different methods of operation. If you cant think for yourself, you&#039;re going to be burned badly. Again.. Compare the last few months of price activity on many different coins, then look at coins like VTC.
&gt;digifags preparing for the endless farmers walk&gt;STILL wont drop their bags and buy something decentwhy do digifags hate money
Selling house and going all in at 1700 Sat
Yes we hate money, now shoo shoo off this board.
Because it&#039;s still up from where it was this time yesterday lol. Sooo much arthritis in this board.
&gt;&gt;2358253you missed the ride from 150sats?stop crying over it, move on.you sound like a fag
&gt;&gt;2358305so did you loser
you mean these money bags?
&gt;&gt;2358266&gt;&gt;2358267&gt;&gt;2358287&gt;&gt;2358305no one is going to pump any more money into this used up whore of a coinenjoy your slow painful journey to the bottom
&gt;&gt;2358315first bought at 43.
I bought 60K at 40 sats two years ago when bitcoin was $250. I&#039;m in for the long haul, they&#039;ve got good tech.
84,000,000 LTC total21,000,000 BTC totalLTC ~ $30BTC ~ $2831Technically, LTC is superior to BTC. LTC has much cheaper and faster TX and otherwise provides everything BTC can do.Scrypt is heavily mined, so network security of LTC is greatBitcoin&#039;s only advantage are network effects, widespread use. But since their RPC APIs are identical, it&#039;s trivial for developers to add LTC support to existing Bitcoin products.It is quite clear that LTC is still extremely undervalued.LTC won&#039;t moon over night but you can expect it to double or triple over the next months.
&gt;&gt;2357935why would you even make this thread?
&gt;&gt;2357935yeah except bitcoin won&#039;t die and LTC will always be a useless btc copycat.try this post again in 2025
&gt;&gt;2357935&gt;LtC Is BetTeR tHan BtC
&gt;&gt;23579351. It&#039;s a proof of work coin with pure transactional use. The TX speed the last time i tested is around 20 minutes, relative to that of ethereum which has massively more application potential.2. There are proof of stake coins which are much faster. &gt;beansI am an ltc holder atm and I think it&#039;s currently the most undervalued coin in the top 10, but not in the whole cryptomarket.
&gt;&gt;2357935ok, i will buy it at 0.004, just look at its weekly ltc/btc chart
litecoin &lt; dogecoin
&gt;&gt;2357989What is the most undervalued then?
&gt;&gt;2357935Fucking bitbean in faster than litecoin
&gt;&gt;2357935litecoin is definitely undervalued, am holding some but not that much.
&gt;&gt;2358024I&#039;d say nothing is undervalued ATM. As much as I believe that cryptocurrencies in general are undervalued even with a $100b marketcap and that fiat, stocks, bonds and real estate are the true bubbles, cryptos are currently in a speculative stage. I expect a market pullback in the near future, but in the long term i expect a true take off as people will be forced to financially educate themselves as the situation over the world gets worse and worse.Bitcoin is facing huge transaction fees, scaling problems and a potential forkNot even a single person has seen a demo of a working dapp on ethereum, is capable of programming a contract, nor ethereum itself has a lightweight wallet that people can use.As for the rest of the currencies, people just keep them on the exchanges waiting to sell. I bet that not even 10% of the people on biz have downloaded a wallet and tested the tech themselves.
&gt;&gt;2357935Bitcoin=GoldLitecoin=Silver&gt;Every other coin is dogshit
&gt;&gt;2357989ethereum is not nearly as secure as btc/ltc
&gt;&gt;2358085Ethereum is literally a meme. A year ago there was way more scepticism around it. Now it&#039;s the same with dgb, it&#039;s hyped and hated as much as eth a year ago.Still I think either all coins are overvalued except cripples and litecoins or litecoins are undervalued.In the longterm bitcoin and ethereum will be worth more, but that growth is not sustainable.
&gt;&gt;235793599% coins still keep founder and play with ludomans by hes own rules
&gt;&gt;2358217what about eth ?
this coin same like Monero coin.property of some exhenger
&gt;&gt;2358037Not once the Lightning network goes live.Then LTC will truly shine.
&gt;i believe in the tech&gt;great dev team&gt;changing the industry
&gt;&gt;2358272Yes, I&#039;ve made tens of thousands on strat already, and it has barely even begun.
&gt;&gt;2358288It&#039;s already over.What&#039;s the next pump? I need to x10 my BTC.
&gt;I shitpost on a business board instead of actually making money or doing business
&gt;&gt;2358272womenunderstandingtech.jpg
&gt;&gt;2358304Research it again and make your own decision.
if a memecoin is being discussed here then chances are you&#039;re already too late. for every poster who gets 10x returns, there&#039;s 100 suckers too embarrassed to post about their failure. leave this board and start reading about every 1-10 satoshi coin that&#039;s out there. if you&#039;re never able to find a good one, maybe you just aren&#039;t cut out for this.
But i don&#039;t go for 10x returns, don&#039;t have time to ride the autismo train, i just ride into the news late, manage to get 2x, sell and repeat everything all over
90% of the time this is true. Sometimes you get that rare coin that is still possible to get in near enough at the bottom that gets shilled here. WAVES, ARK &amp; SC are just a couple that I&#039;ve seen recently that have massive upside potential that has been shilled here quite a lot recently.
&gt;&gt;2357721&gt;there&#039;s 100 suckers too embarrassed to post about their failureif you lurked more the ratio between win threads and kys threads is 1:20
&gt;&gt;2357721Mooncoin proves you wrong.
&gt;&gt;2358070&gt;WAVES, ARK &amp; SC&gt;why?&gt;great team, great community, great marketing&gt;b-buy!!
I&#039;ve been putting all my money into Iconomi so far and it&#039;s doing well. I&#039;ve heard from some anons that Iconomi is a shit place to put it in. Are there any alternatives to this?
&gt;I&#039;ve heard from some anons that Iconomi is a shit place to put it in.Why? You shouldn&#039;t listen to anyone in here. /biz/ is for shilling your shitcoins that have already pumped, you will find 0 good advice.That being said, ICN is a good hold. Even if US citizens won&#039;t be able to utilize it.
EH WHY IS BEGGING NOT A BANNABLE OFFENCE?
It is.The question you should be asking is why do we not have any mods
&gt;&gt;2357660I wish I could suck my own dick, man.
&gt;&gt;2357660Most beggars provide no value at all, they don&#039;t do a shit to deserve a donation. If they tried to entertain us at least, there would be more odds in their favor.Btw, are beggars really banned? I have never begged for chump change here. Just curious if there are anons banned for begging.
&gt;&gt;2357763Do you think anyone posting any kind of crypto coin nonsense adds value? Every thread is just another idiot shilling garbage they purchased.
&gt;&gt;2357763they should at least ban someone with those redwords(THIS USER HAS BEEN BANNED)
&gt;&gt;2357756I wish I could draw me sucking my own dick.
&gt;&gt;2357756It&#039;s totally not worth it. I was able to do it when I was a kissless virgin at 12yo, doesn&#039;t feel special.You definitely want someone sucking your dick for you, feels much better.
&gt;&gt;2357725Probably couldn&#039;t handle deleting shill threads every 0.2 seconds
&gt;&gt;2357963Yeah I figure that&#039;s the reason, but it feels like they never even tried. They have the ban announcement red text feature for a reason. Fucking use it.
&gt;&gt;2357763I never saw anyone here being banned on /biz/, even idiots who posted porn.
&gt;&gt;2357725&gt;&gt;2358090Use the report button you faggots, or do you expect others to do it for you? I personally reported at least 4-5 posts/threads yesterday and all of them got deleted. It doesn&#039;t happen instantaneously obviously, give it 15-30 min.
&gt;&gt;2358127What was their content?
&gt;&gt;2357660I&#039;m more annoyed that half of the threads are shills shillings yoloshit coins

&gt;&gt;2357397Whether it&#039;s official or not it&#039;s great, I wonder what happens when you tip someone who doesn&#039;t have a redd I&#039;d? Does it invite them to join?

How many dips does a nocoiner need to miss to become a coiner?
LiteDoge has the brand power to make it to Bittrex. It&#039;s being shilled every minute of every day on Twitter. How many weeks before it 10xs again is up to you. Embrace the litest doge. Let him cometh upon you. For LiteDoge is the one true doge.
Where to buy
this shit hasn&#039;t had a github commit in over 2 yearsbeware the P&amp;D
&gt;&gt;2351178I bought on Cryptopia. There you can buy not only with BTC, but also with LTC and DOGE. Their deposits are fast.Never approach YoBit.
&gt;&gt;2351196It&#039;s literally perfect already, why fix something that isn&#039;t broken?
&gt;&gt;2351196the devs are still around and it&#039;s already perfect. A transaction takes 20s to confirm. Already better than 90% of the coins in the top 100 who think they can make trivial projects useful by making them in the blockchain
Proof of stakeDOGECOIN
&gt;&gt;2351365How much does it pay for staking?I have 5 Million ldoge.
&gt;&gt;2350888Just bought in.
&gt;&gt;2351614I also have 5 million and didn&#039;t get any block yet. It&#039;s in staking mode for one day
Does nova let me turn BTC into LDOGE? I don&#039;t see an option.
&gt;&gt;2351794I personally bought on Cryptopia, but maybe Nova only has the LDOGE/DOGE market. If so, you&#039;ll have to buy DOGE and then spend it on LDOGE.
&gt;&gt;2351794Yes, but it&#039;s not turning BTC into LDOGE, it&#039;s buying LDOGE with BTC
&gt;&gt;2351794https://novaexchange.com/market/BTC_LDOGE/
&gt;&gt;2351946Great, feels good I was wrong
are you serious the ldoge on yobit is not the same coin, and if i wanted to withdraw from yobit to criptopia i&#039;d lose it all?
&gt;&gt;2352590Absolutely, LDOGE on YoBit not only cannot be withdrawn, it&#039;s more susceptible to dumps (and hence you losing money). Over the past day it was dumped more than in half, I think. Its price is in no way dependent on the price of genuine LDOGE, which is going strong.tldr; Cryptopia is the way to go
&gt;&gt;2352590Can&#039;t you understand that yobit is a scam... Just don&#039;t use this shit. Never.
its bleeding
selling the bags
consider the following, me and a lot of people i know uses DOGE to transfer funds between exchanges as it is the cheapest and a really fast coin. also the price tend to stay somewhat stable. the transaction time of DOGE is around 10 mins. the transaction time for litedoge is 20 seconds?! Im in!! If this coin get established this will be my coin for transering funds between exchanges!
&gt;&gt;2355838This coin has good potential, since it&#039;s proof of stake you can throw it on a cheap ARM computer and have it mining 24/7. So it can have many nodes with minimal power use keeping the network very fast.
&gt;&gt;2356225neat! do you or any one here know a cheap ARM computer that you can use for this?
&gt;&gt;2352630&gt;&gt;2353978its okay, thanks i got out 1:1...
&gt;&gt;2356821Odroid xu4 is probably the best value, raspberryPi will work but is much slower if you want to use it for anything else.
&gt;&gt;2357138i just want the cheapest that dont run the fan to loud
&gt;&gt;2357241Just get one of these with an emmc, raspi is cheaper but has a bunch of irritating limitations.http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G145457216438
Does anyone actually know the proof of stake percentage of it? Didn&#039;t see anything about it on btctalk
&gt;&gt;2351196Devs are currently working on new features, but their marketing team sucks balls so no one knows about it. Go to the IRC channel and talk to them.Mentioning marketing, I think they&#039;re putting a team together.
&gt;&gt;2357278thanks!
&gt;&gt;2358059I&#039;m not entirely sure how it works, I have 2 million ldoge, first parcel mined was 500 ldoge.
What are the most important things to know before undertaking a start-up?I&#039;m sitting on an untapped multi-million market, and really excited but also don&#039;t want to get caught with my dick out. The business model has already been successful in the States and Australia, but my country as always is late in adopting it. My intention is to learn from them, improve their model, and implement it here (New Zealand).For more context, it is an online service - the main capital costs being company registration and marketing (very important).I will only need to take on one other person (a developer), but I also want as much control as possible. I&#039;ll have to negotiate a division of shares, as I don&#039;t have the capital to hire a developing for a long period of time. I&#039;m willing to invest the money for marketing ($5,000) - but it does seem a little low.My main concerns surround:- Investors (I want to avoid them, my own capital first).- An inability to maintain power, and/or the vision of the company in conflict- Shares, dilution and other weird shit- CoupsAre these normal concerns?Surely there are some powerful books on this subject, and how not to get absolutely cuckolded by another founder - or perhaps, by post-startup executives or investors?Does anyone have any feedback, experiences or stories - heads up?
You could hire a developer for market salary and have him work office hours, you don&#039;t have to worry about power or anything then. But if you don&#039;t have the cash or you want him to work 24/7 on this and be emotionally invested in the success, then you&#039;re looking more at a cofounder-like situation I&#039;d guess.Talk to a lawyer/accountant.Also maybe read Paul Graham&#039;s essays.source: I read hackernews a lot
WHATS THE UNTAPPED MARKET ANON
&gt;&gt;2357280&gt;popular in the States and Australiaeither cuck porn or fidget spinners would be my guessGOOD LUCK OP
&gt;&gt;2357056https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI&amp;list=PLXIzh6qwMf9htBjuMGPWVoPE-1Jk0oeep
&gt;&gt;2357258Thanks - I&#039;ve been thinking about it and I suppose I could learn the web development areas that it&#039;ll require. Unfortunately, that may take up to a year combined with my other responsibilities - and since they&#039;ll be financial transactions I&#039;m a bit concerned about security and privacy (hence, my interest in getting a dev).Currently, I can&#039;t afford a developer for market salary. I&#039;ll need a lawyer for the company&#039;s constitution but I have access to a lawyer and accountant.I&#039;ll look into Graham&#039;s essays. Thanks for that anon.&gt;&gt;2357280I&#039;m combining cuck porn and fidget spinners - I call it, faggot spinners.&gt;&gt;2357280&gt;&gt;2357310Thanks!
&gt;&gt;2357056you wanna dev? I&#039;m available right now (&gt;10 years exp.)... but not knowing what you are headed for is sub-optimal.I&#039;ve always loved to help :))
&gt;&gt;2357345I barely trust the devs I meet in-person.
&gt;&gt;2357376you&#039;re fucking noob faggot!I can tell, coz U smell of it.Every fucking mofo thinks he has the one and great idea, and can&#039;t talk to anyone about it. If you ever have even been in business, you know it&#039;s hard work. Everything is. Nobody is going to copy you that easy. If you are not open about your business you wil get BUUUURRRNED...
&gt;&gt;2357376also, I&#039;m OUT! That&#039;s how fast U loose!
&gt;&gt;2357412&gt;Every fucking mofo thinks he has the one and great idea, and can&#039;t talk to anyone about it. If you ever have even been in business, you know it&#039;s hard work. Everything is. Nobody is going to copy you that easy. If you are not open about your business you wil get BUUUURRRNED...what the fuck did I just read.The reason I don&#039;t trust them is because I don&#039;t know them well enough to do business with them. I don&#039;t know their work ethic, their motives, their personalities.The first step of doing business with someone is to know who you&#039;re doing business with. I also can&#039;t tell if you&#039;re joking with your replies.
&gt;&gt;2357423rofl, ure like one of the guys who try picking up a chick and start raging like a turboautist, calling them fat, ugly etc. when they get rejected
&gt;&gt;2357444&gt;&gt;2357445you mofos, like I have nothing to do LEL.I help small companies all the time, developing.You don&#039;t have to trust others NOOB. You get a contract, which says &quot;if you tell anybody I get 300.000 $ in BTC&quot;... DON&#039;T YOU KNOW ANYTHING? it&#039;s standard procedure. Have u even worked at a company yet?
&gt;&gt;2357509lmao @ ur life dude
&gt;&gt;2357056What is stopping the successful companies in US and Aus from expanding into the NZ market and crushing your business like a paper cup?Like Uber did to that NZ ride hailing app in Auckland &quot;Zoomy&quot;. &quot;oh my god, I will make Uber for NZ and be rich!!!1&quot; - No, only network-effects business like Trademe can do thatWhich Part of NZ are you in? Chch here
&gt;&gt;2357633I&#039;m not even angry. He just should make it, do it. If you can&#039;t trust you can&#039;t build.Keeping everything under your own control is the right mindset. Just don&#039;t be too scared. Everything involves doing work. If you are passionate about your idea, people will follow you.Stop assuming that everybody wants to fuck you over and grab you buy your ideas. Keeping your business a secret won&#039;t help you for long.Also, eventually every relationship will be tense at some point. So often it&#039;s much better to work with strangers.Hope, this is clearer.I get sucked into this kind of language...Take an example. I&#039;m just beginning to develop a voting platform, based on NEM. It&#039;s an idea. Will someone steal it now? I JUST DON&#039;T CARE xD
&gt;&gt;2357790&gt;What is stopping the successful companies in US and Aus from expanding into the NZ market and crushing your business like a paper cup?Because that simple doesn&#039;t happen all the time.Hella pizza is a NZ company that started after the international companies established themselves and have given them the middle finger and constantly grown.
&gt;&gt;2357790The United States companies are still expanding across their states, there&#039;s obviously far more profit in doing so than expanding into New Zealand&#039;s market. They may be looking at European markets as well.The Australian one is still localised in Australia, and trying to expand (it&#039;s done it a bit slower than the U.S one). They&#039;re looking at the U.S for expansion, but still haven&#039;t undertaken it yet.New Zealand is always the last market considered because we&#039;re so small. TradeMe is a good example, propped up while eBay was still expanding across the States.
&gt;&gt;2357790I&#039;m in Wellington as well.
DGB did not win.Yeah, that seems to suck... but why?They still got their attention and connections.https://snopow.com.au/ is in for a longterm partnershipSource: https://twitter.com/SnopowAUS/status/873127101095858176As is learninlaravelSource: https://twitter.com/LearningLaravel/status/873071224460517377The day has only started.Get the word out, the stuff will go back to the 3k and further up.PS: there is one thing that nobody mentioned so far: because they did NOT win, they can enter the global contest of CitiT4IChallenge.MORE publicity.MORE support.MORE hype like last week.Source: https://steemit.com/digibyte/@cwkim0100/dgb-citit4ichallenge#@twitterbot/re-dgb-citit4ichallenge-20170609t120342 - hint: translate it to english.
Did DGB even present yet? Citibank goes on for a couple of days
you&#039;re a better person than me for trying to help people onto the train at this point, so much FUD round here
&gt;&gt;2358028Winner hasn&#039;t even been announced wtf are you talking about?
&gt;&gt;2358065https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin/status/873129928010739713They &quot;lost&quot; todays competition (aka didnt got the 1st place).
&gt;&gt;2358028Digibyte has a global event with CitiBank later in July now with hundreds of prizes. Global also means more exposure which will include vast majority of companies.Tweet:https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin/status/873130313181954048
DGB IS A FUCKING SINKING SHIP DUMBASShave fun with those bags
&gt;&gt;2358028LMAO, citibank is nothing you fucking retardyou fucking morons have been clinging to this citibank garbage like it fucking means anything - have you even looked at past winners and what happened to them??faded into fucking nothing, just like digibye, the pets.com of cryptocurrency
This event lasts for days and awards are given throughout. They could probably get an award for &quot;biggest shill team&quot; or &quot;coin with most pussyhanders&quot; or &quot;cutest autist with sinking ship powerpoint&quot; and still end up in the green in a few week because of connections and networking which is the whole point of these stupid contests, to get a little ticm under your logo on &quot;2017 winner of biggest fudders in crypto&quot; or whatever.
&gt;&gt;2358081Not to mention it gives the time required for investors and businesses who&#039;ve only just been introduced to digibyte and the technology to get their heads around how much money and time it will save them.This stuff is so new to so many businesses that their own experts need to catch up.I&#039;m hodling and gonna buy the dip too.
&gt;&gt;2358081&quot;If you win this tournament, you will not be able to advance to the global main tournament.&quot;This is exactly what I was saying in the last part of my post.It is GOOD that they did not get 1st place, ffs. It is hard to belive, but yeah - we will have a repetition of this whole stuff next month.
&gt;&gt;2358084it&#039;s hovering around it&#039;s bottom, that&#039;s not a sinking ship anon
Meanwhile the past replies be like........
&gt;&gt;2358084Weak hands?
&gt;&gt;2358044Yes, apparently autists suck at public speaking, who would have guessed?
&gt;&gt;2358044yup, this is just about what I expectednone of you bagholders even following the competition, just hoping for a pump without even knowing basic stock movementssell the fucking news retards
&gt;&gt;2358135That&#039;s a charming comic.
&gt;&gt;2358098But why do you care? Why are you trying so hard to devalue this coin? By calling us retards constantly and spamming the same posts in every dgb thread it makes me wonder why you&#039;re wasting so much of your time on this.
&gt;&gt;2358028OP nice shill but our current tactic is to tell /biz/nessmen that the winner has not been announced yet/DGB hasn&#039;t even presentedplease delete this thread
&gt;&gt;2358028Time to take some more off the weak hands for cheaper prices.
&gt;&gt;2358214Getting weakhands to sell this way. He is one of the accumulating investors that dont care if the price goes bonkers tomorrow or today.The FUD in the past 2 hours was sick.
&gt;&gt;2358187you have me giggling with your first line
CHECK OUT THIS BIG NEWS FROM DGB HOLY SHIT
Reeeeeee
&gt;&gt;2356677it isnt even over yethttps://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin/status/873130313181954048
BUT MUH MINECRAFT!?!?!?
&gt;&gt;2356677lol what were we thinking?i like dgb but zog always wins in the end&gt;we thought something to break free from kike central banking would win over antichrist tier surveillance tech
I own 80k$ usd DGB and 160k$ XVGAMA
&gt;&gt;2356852Who gives a fuck?
&gt;&gt;2356852what are some good ways to kill myself?
well it will be worth ~40k $ soon if you dont sell
&gt;&gt;2356852ditch that garbage, invest in a real project, SWT with all your money.
Jesus rest in piece
should i sell bois or baghold it?im willing to go down with the ship as this is chump change (im part of a banking family)
&gt;&gt;2356906invest in ARK , ICN and 1ST. actual good coins that provide a real use in the future
&gt;&gt;2356906invest in siacoin, BTS and in BTCD (short term)and send me some of your XVG please senpai, I&#039;m a poorfagDK3sr54ZBQX3CTsAhTB64A4K8xkMwVJ1bz
&gt;&gt;2356906Just hold. I have DGB, XVG, ZEN and best of all, LomoCoin.It&#039;ll all work out in the end.
You literally invested into meme coins. What. the. fuck
OP, look into (and by look, I mean some actual fucking research):IOCSTRAT1STARKWagerrWith that kind of money, you want to avoid volatile memecoins that have nothing going for them tech wise, in the end, you&#039;ll end up holding bags. But it&#039;s your money.
XVG and LMC holdler reporting herehodl on guyswe&#039;ll be billionaires
You&#039;re not holding RDD? lmao
&gt;&gt;2358083Why Lmc ? Do I missed something ? I thought its a pump and dump like kids or xby ?Hold a lot of xvg but the wall around 200 will be hard to take down.
Just rip my insides plz:)
ARK can stay at this price forever and I&#039;ll have still profited. My other coins can do whatever the fuck they want since I have barely anything in them comparatively
&gt;&gt;2357862$300 is nothing.
&gt;&gt;2357862Zencash for sure was gonna moon and then that asshole developer left.
lads, when i record a sale to btc in blockfolio do i manually need to create a corresponding buy transaction?
&gt;&gt;2357862just copy traders on 1broker.cc and fuel your shitcoin trading with the gains (usally 5% daily)
Why don&#039;t Google or Microsoft just make thier own coin?
They almost never do. Big companies just don&#039;t do this sort of thing. They end up buying a company that does, but in this case they can&#039;t without pumping the coin 10000%
Unless I&#039;m gravely mistaken...the coin is not what it is important to business about the blockchain.In their use of blockchain technology, they are likely to use private tokens that are ascribed no monetary technology.Proclomations that &#039;blockchain is the future&#039; may be well founded, but shouldn&#039;t mean crypto prices go up.feel like a lot of new players (i.e. XRP) don&#039;t actually require a coin, they just use it for funding purposes. When businesses implement ripple technology, they aren&#039;t adopting the currency itself.
&gt;&gt;2356484Google might.Microsoft would just buy some existing coin and rename it.
&gt;&gt;2356508This, startup tech is like small drug companies, they want to be bought out by the big boys usually. It&#039;s just easier that way.
&gt;&gt;2356616Microsoft is in the EEA.
MFW that&#039;s my fetish.
&gt;&gt;2356508This right hereThere is no innovation, only buyoutst. works for big company
&gt;&gt;2356508So does that mean we&#039;re safe from Google/Facebook/Microsoft-coin for now?
&gt;&gt;2357164they could acquire something and let it run independently.honestly though, you&#039;d think megacorps like google starting a coin would be seen as an actual threat by nation states.it makes more sense for them to invest in blockchain tech to license out.
We have a Google coin doh.https://www.google.com/amp/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/09/15/google-backed-blockchain-start-up-ripple-raises-55-million-from-big-banks.html
&gt;&gt;2356484&gt;Wait for ther asshole to dilate when passing air&gt;Quickly stick my dong inside before the window closes&gt;The pressure builds inside her&gt;Her head blows&gt;?????&gt;Cum
&gt;&gt;2356484google has a coin dude...
&gt;&gt;2356537You are absolutely right.
&gt;&gt;2356484Cose bitcoin dont have owner, Bitcon it public domain.
You have less than 5 hours to link your BTCs to Byteball so you can get free byteballs.Next free byteball distribution will be in a month!Here is a guide on how to do it:byteballblog.wordpress.comI&#039;m fucking ready!&gt; Address is linked (good!), with a balance of bytes 7,044,707,570 and BTC 0.40008284 You will receive 1,433,946,692 bytes and 3,027,204,860 Blackbytes during round number 6.
I love how everyone shills this garbage at the last second.
&gt;&gt;2355852I&#039;ve been shilling it for at least 3 days anon.Trying to help my /biz/ brothers
&gt;&gt;2355852It&#039;s free, so why not?It also seems to be a legitimately good coin. DGA consensus algorithm which apparently avoids the scaling problems of blockchain, conditional payments, private transactions, etc.
&gt;&gt;2355852It&#039;s quick, don&#039;t worry about it. And he has been speaking about it for a while. I&#039;m in for a couple of btc (I exchanged them to GByte). I&#039;ll get around 1600$ at current market rate.
I&#039;m not at my computer right now, so unless I can get a bitcoin wallet in an hour, I doubt I can take advantage of this.
&gt;&gt;2355915still 4 hours left. You have time.
&gt;tfw I never have BTC and always hold it in alts.
&gt;&gt;2355929Just buy Byteball.https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GBYTE1 GByte = 0.3 btc. But you don&#039;t need to buy 1 unit to receive the bonus. If you buy 0.5 Gbyte, you&#039;ll get 20% of that. That&#039;s 0.1Gbyte. At the current rate, you&#039;ll get 80 bucks for having a measly 0.15btc stuck for a day or two.
tfw too lazy to do it
&gt;&gt;2355977It&#039;s literally the easiest money you&#039;ll get for 5 minutes of effort.
&gt;tfw too broke to do it
3 hours and 43 minutes leftI&#039;m going out now, so maybe when I&#039;m back I&#039;ll be 20% richer.the price will probably go down right after the distribution though, but I&#039;m a holdergood luck to all of you!
&gt;&gt;2355990i would need to transfer my btc to electrumno way mate, and how much will i get in USD for 0.06 btc? most of my holdings are in alts
I&#039;ll do this next month I think. I would have loved to do it, but I don&#039;t wanna dump all my shit right now. Thanks OP.
&gt;&gt;2356078no problem1 hour and 17 minutes left!basically this is your last chance people (until next month)good luck!
I just linked a small amount of BTC. Let&#039;s see if it works. Probably the price will drop immediately after the airdrop though.
Wait you can link your btc without actually taking the btc out of your wallet?
&gt;&gt;2357600put your byteball address here to see if it is linkedhttps://byteball.fr/BBdistribution.php
&gt;&gt;2357707yes, talk to the bot, and do as he says. He gives you 2 options, one option is to sign a messagesign a message using your BTC address with the coins (you could have several addresses, can link them all however)and put your byteball address as the content of the messagedon&#039;t forget to tell the address to the bot beforehand
&gt;&gt;2357707And actually the problem most people have is that they don&#039;t have BTC in their wallet, but they have it in exchanges or something.if it&#039;s in the wallet you just need to prove that you own that address.Here is a guide: byteballblog.wordpress.comyou got exactly 30 minutes, good luck
Trying to get my byteballs before the drop on my phone, wish me luck
&gt;&gt;2357736shut up, concentrate on it, and good luck.Don&#039;t forget this guide:byteballblog.wordpress.com
Just one warning, the snapshot happens in 11 minutes (ideally)And then, in theory, you could move back your BTC to wherever, and sell your GBytes or whatever the hell you want to do.BUTI still wouldn&#039;t move anything until you receive the bytes and black bytesAND REMEMBER TO DO A FULL BACKUP
&gt;&gt;2357919What is the deal with BlackBytes? Can I also sell them?
&gt;&gt;2357934yes and noThey are more private coins, much more anonymous. Apparently you can sell them already in their slack, P2P, (with conditional transactions, you don&#039;t need to trust anybody)And since they are trying to keep them very anonymous, they would need a decentralized exchange. (which is in the works apparently)Also another warning, I read that you have to make a backup of your wallet every time you get new black bytes, because of the nature of the black bytes themselves.I&#039;ll just hold them until I can do something useful with them, but they will probably be worth something one day too.I have no idea for how much they can be traded right now in the slack channel though.
&gt;&gt;2357934more (official) info here:https://wiki.byteball.org/blackbytes
&gt;&gt;2357731I was too late :( messed the signature up somehow
&gt;&gt;2358067keep trying, maybe the snapshot will be delayed
&gt;&gt;2358067still no official word that the snapshot was taken
&gt;&gt;2358092the bot said &quot;sorry you are too late, try again next time&quot;Did it want the signed message including those----- start signed message----things?
&gt;&gt;2358133When I signed it, it was just a string of numbers and letters, nothing like that in the signature for me, but I used bitcoin core.Sorry about that anon :(There will be a new one on the next full moon, so be ready for that one.This is where most of the talk happens: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1608859.9300
I was literally dumb enough to use CoinbaseRestarted my attempt but I think I was too late
&gt;&gt;2355702Didn&#039;t get shit yet.
&gt;&gt;2358212the snapshot happened, but the distribution takes a few hours apparently. This is my first distribution but that&#039;s what I readJust be a bit more patient.Literally thousands of transactions have to happen now to give the coins to everyone.Even thishttps://byteball.fr/BBdistribution.phpis telling me to wait.
I expected a big dump, which &quot;sort of&quot; happened, it went down from 0.3 to 0.27, but it&#039;s now back to 0.3 after just 5 mintuesI wanted to buy more but for much lower than that...Maybe there is still hope for the price to go down
&gt;2017&gt;Not holding NGRIt&#039;s like you want to stay poorNiggerCoin at 420k sats, was 69 sats 4 days ago.Get in before integration with Popeyes Chicken &amp; KFC becomes official next month! We&#039;re going to the moon!

&gt;&gt;2353392lel

&gt;&gt;2353314Yobit would probably accept some shit like this.
NGR 3/5 btc by 2018
&gt;&gt;2352462niggercoin is the same as shitcoin
NIGGER COIN TO THE MOON.
&gt;&gt;2353481Are white people allowed to use this coin or is like the word where only black people can use it?
&gt;&gt;2353442made me giggle
&gt;&gt;2353611It&#039;s not white people that can use it too.It&#039;s black people that can use it too.
Or check out White Coin on bittrex
&gt;&gt;2352462Where can I find the black paper?
can someone pay 0.03 BTC to create NiggerCoin? https://www.walletbuilders.com/a coin born in 4CHAN
&gt;&gt;2353736Lets do it NiggerCoin to the moonSpread rumors that governments are integrating it with social welfare programs. NGR instead of welfare cheques and food stamps, no paper, all instantaneous
&gt;&gt;2352462hodling miltiple bags since 10 satsLETS GO NIGGAS BIXNOOD YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Make this a real coin
&gt;&gt;2353736I&#039;ll unironically invest in nigger coin
do you think this nigger coin can be ever on an exchange, im talking cos the name its a bit offensive for non 4chan people
&gt;&gt;2354010If we see adoption by the masses, im willing to change the name to AfriCoin to be less offensive. Until then, NiggerCoin to the moon
&gt;&gt;2354039were is the source code and the bitcointalk ann?
Should&#039;ve called it Bitnigger.Just has a nice ring to it.
&gt;&gt;2354091How about Niggereum?
&gt;bitmelonWe will get the joke and everyone else not.&gt;hey Jamal, this coin was made specially for you
&gt;&gt;2354108and the quantity smaller than an Niggereum?NiggerToshit
&gt;&gt;2353313fucking hell
&gt;&gt;2354039I&#039;m fine with africoin as long as it is called niggercoin colloquially
&gt;&gt;2354122Niggoshi
HODL
so whos gona make it?
&gt;&gt;2354175&gt;0.03That&#039;s too expensive desu.
&gt;&gt;2354175Of someone did it I would be grateful. We can change the name to NiggaByte or something catchy like the one anon said.This would gain media traction for being racist, an ez moon ride
&gt;&gt;2353611god this is one of the best movies ever
we need another meme coin like dogecoin, niggatoshit its the answer
&gt;&gt;2353736I can do it myself f o r f r e e. Give me some more ideas and I can get it started tomorrow.
&gt;&gt;2353313why does that actually sound like something an exchange would call themselves?
&gt;not buying master race whitecoin
&gt;&gt;2354460i bet some shitty exchange like nova shitoshitrade or coinexchange will add this niggacoin
&gt;&gt;2354436The Bean is the Superior Meme
&gt;&gt;2354453The only crypto to integrate with fast food chains like KFC.
&gt;&gt;2353442Came to post this
&gt;&gt;2354170UP

&gt;&gt;2354453NiggerCoin, BitNigger, NiggaByte, NiggerBit or Niggereum. We should take a vote. We can make the coin more HD, idk about the technical specs just do what&#039;s easiest

NiggaByte i would unironically buy, the other, maybe not
&gt;&gt;2354999Then it has to be NiggaByte. Also when you accumulate 1000 NiggaBytes, it can be referred to as 1 NiggaBit
and 0.00000001 will be a Niggatoshit

Xdn is a shitcoin but not a streetshittingcoinHodl for a few months BoyzWe&#039;re gonna make it
So all the older (2014~) crypto coins have had their pump, doge, vert, redd, etc but not gridcoin. It&#039;s still sitting tight slowly getting pulled up by btcs gain, but it&#039;s prime for a 5 fold+ lift.Anyone holding at the mo?
Planning tu buy as they really seems legit. A lot of developer activity which proves they are actually doing something every day.
&gt;&gt;2357861The fact that they&#039;ve been around since 2014 and are still active developing is pretty insane in crypto land
if you look at dev score on this site they are on 14th place which is a lot more than their mcap.. Still doing some research but i will invest 99%https://www.coingecko.com/en?sort_by=developer_score
&gt;&gt;2357827it was just recently pumped
&gt;&gt;2357827&gt;So all the older (2014~) crypto coins have had their pumpnot really99% of the coins from 2014 have disappeared, this is a candidate to disappear this month
&gt;&gt;2358112That was a month ago and it&#039;s almost trended back up to that level...I reckon it has legs.
Don&#039;t miss out on the hot new yobit shill fest, KGC, volume exploded from 5 sat to 8 sat in an hour, 8 sat almost gone, and we&#039;re going to 30 easily, less than 1 btc between here and there
&gt;&gt;2358164nope im out
&gt;&gt;2358177When did you get in anon
&gt;The ship is sinkingMarket volatility is how people get rich.But by all means, hand your bags over to me faggots.
&gt;&gt;2357213Yes, please take my bags.I used to be on the dgb train, but then I realized we can&#039;t let Digibyte get the nuclear codes.
&gt;&gt;2357213&gt;he doesn&#039;t understand trend lines
&gt;&gt;2357213You do realize that any real value any good coin has is completely overridden by emotion memeing in this market?You can literally make money off cryptos by saying to yourself, &#039;What would the internet do if given X news, or fed X hype?&#039;Selling DGB now and buying it back when it reaches the lagged dip when slow indecisive dumbasses finish selling is how you make money.
&gt;&gt;2357340https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest
I keep seeing sales of 5-50 DGB so it seems like a bot trying to decrease the value of DGB.
It&#039;s a fucking sinking ship you retards
They don&#039;t know how much this coin will be worth.They dont know.They dont deserve it.
What are some smart mid-to-high barrier to entry investments I can make with my crypto gains? I&#039;m 20 now with $20k in crypto and would like to be a millionaire by 30
&gt;&gt;2358089I don&#039;t know; Look into the stock market maybe; Diversify a bit. You can consider opening a legit business if you can handle that sort of a thing.
How does it feel making the worst financial decision of your life by panicselling now?
&gt;&gt;2357493&gt;wow a shitty paint meme graph designed to hold on to the last vestige of FOMO over an ovehyped, literally intrinsically worthless coinThere&#039;s no reason DGB will moon from here. I cashed out well into the green and I&#039;m happy, but bagholders will go the way of POSW and PIVX bagholders
&gt;He thinks stock/crypto/anything just goes up and up and upLook at the 1month charts and see this repeated over and over.
&gt;&gt;2357624No dumbass, DGB is a crash and burn.Look at you still trying to copeHave fun holding those bags
&gt;&gt;2357836You have to be a complete retard to say something this stupid. Even if you&#039;re fudding, this is terrible fudding.At least try.
&gt;&gt;2357900When the only thing they can answer back is &quot;FUD&quot;, it&#039;s the beggining of the end.Enjoy holding my bags, retard
&gt;&gt;2357924Nice try.The guy I replied to didn&#039;t say anything himself.Go ahead, why is DGB dying? 1900 sats after a drop from 2300, versus a drop from 2600 to 1600.
&gt;&gt;2357836Screencapped this. Will repost when time is right.
&gt;&gt;2357966You can screencap the whole 4chan no one gives a fucklook at all these memes trying to save dgb
&gt;&gt;2357624I hold DGB but these retarded charts don&#039;t mean anything.
I&#039;m making a new screencap folder for panic sellers :^)
&gt;&gt;2357836When you bought in at 160 sats, it&#039;s all good. By the time it &quot;crashes&quot; some idiot that bought in at 1000 is scooping it up at a &quot;low&quot; price, which drives it back to an ATH. Fuck yeah!
&gt;&gt;2357836But it barely crashed at all? Your argument seems pretty invalid
Redpill me on the&gt;1 sat buy&gt;2 sat sellstrategy. Also yobit or nova?
it&#039;s called a scam not a strategy.
Literally all scamcoins, but you just have to get in early. You can also get stuck with bags for a while.
What the others say. Although in most cases you will be able to sell at least for your initial 1sat. Look for coins with high volumes, LAGA on nova or however this diarrhoea is called
&gt;&gt;2357140They are all a scam, stay away from yobit.Most of us learnt this the hard way.
&gt;&gt;2357140Yes for instance I am myself stuck with the fuckin scam that is LAGA coin on Novexchange
Both of these seem to be the most shilled coins on /biz/ atm.Which one has more potential and is better for lth (long term hold)?
YOU ARE A FUCKING RETARD IF YOU EVEN HAVE TO ASK
DGB costs less, you might aswell get in now before we win citibankArk is good too but I&#039;m a digiboi at heart
Ark hasn&#039;t even mooned yet.New coin with huge plans in the future. The next 2 years will be a steady rise.
Look at the pathetic minecraft server that dgb shills are so proud of and that is the answerp
One&#039;s a meme and one has potential. Up to you to do the research as to which is which
&gt;&gt;2356148&gt;shilled&gt;goodyour money will just fuel the trading bots - don&#039;t waste them on any of these
ECC
&gt;&gt;2356148I got money on both
&gt;&gt;2356200This
&gt;tfw on ARK for 3 days now&gt;all this time hovering around 1$What is this shit
&gt;&gt;2356148NONE.Rn : Aragon, SiaCoin, TokenCard and Iconomi
&gt;&gt;2357386Whales/bots want to keep accumulating, so they&#039;re keeping the price low. Each day we go, the rocket just adds more fuel
PascalCoin is about to moon
&gt;&gt;2357386join the /biz/ delegate and make more coins while we wait for the moonARK, ICN are good coins imho
&gt;&gt;2356148Both
They both are god tier. only time will tell whos best.My bets on ARK
I have invested half of my portfio into both and am heavy in the green with Ark and am part of the biz delegation to soon earn more. Dgb is a good lth too but its going to be volatile for the next couple days with rumors and panic sells. Unironically and memes asidex dgb has good potential for the long term and if you pay attention, it has dipped and mooned many times with whales trying to accumulate. If you bought into the dank maymays on how you were gonna get rich off of either you are an idiot. Just hodl and see what happens in a week. Its a volatile growth market in a bull run, its going to be okay.
Who here /patrician-coins/?&gt;FCT&gt;WAVES&gt;BNT&gt;LYKKE
Putting 100 in crypto today25 split on ARK, DGB, ESPERS and SIADo I need a wallet for each of those or is there a wallet that can accept all of those?
&gt;&gt;2357338Also thinking about RDD
&gt;&gt;2357338bittrex
&gt;&gt;2357403Bittrex has universal wallets?
either leave it on an exchange (and risk it all via hack e.g., mt gox) or get wallets for each
SIA and ARK are solid bets. I&#039;d pump more into SIA instead of DGB. Too many shit giggles trying to pump the stock, sleep better with a solid long term bet.
&gt;&gt;2357338When you have tiny amounts of money to play with, don&#039;t invest in expensive coins. For buying 1 ARK you could buy 298 doge coins, buy low and sell high. Your profit margin on day trading cheaper coins is going to be significantly higher.
&gt;&gt;2358050the price of each individual coin doesn&#039;t fucking matter, it&#039;s relative. when are you idiots going to learn this
Ok i&#039;m pretty new to non-bitcoin cryptcurrencies, what is the most profitable to MINE right now?
SHUT THE FUCK UP NEWFAGGET OUTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;&gt;2357916Nicehash will (AFAIK) let you mine whatever is most profitable at the time for your rig, but if you want stability I&#039;d go simple, claymore and ETH
Just sold my 1 million DGB to go all in on JNUG for trumps impeachment.U MAD? U MAD?U MAD?
&gt;impeachmentDude their smoking gun James comey turned out to be nothing at all.
STEEM
&gt;JNUGwut?
&gt;&gt;2357887HAHAHAHAHAHAIt&#039;s funny because you&#039;re seriousAnyway JNUG is low as fuck, might be a good idea.
&gt;&gt;2357830Is Augur/Gnosis working yet? Can people bet on this?
Funny when DGB fudders say some retarded political crap to go along with it.I only see signs to hold DGB when they go all out like this.
&gt;&gt;2357997Enjoy holding those bags retard.
&gt; decentralized VPN&gt; just finished ICO&gt; will hit bitterx soonwill this shit make me rich
&gt;&gt;2357274Whales will probably dump it.Whats were the ICO details?
&gt;&gt;2357577People were smoothly buying it for 1 hour. I doubt there were any big whales. All the whales probably skipped it in favor of BAT the next day
Mysterium token sale went quite fast, selling out in 45 minutes.https://medium.com/mysterium-network/mysterium-token-sale-aftermath-d05f0ae2ae55
So now that DGB is ded, where do we move on?
&gt;&gt;2357102ReddcoinPotential to hit 2Kbut I&#039;m holding longterm anyway
&gt;&gt;2357102SIA nigger. Should have jumped on the train yesterday.
https://yobit.net/en/trade/VTY/BTCthin ass walls
I sold everything at 2200 and threw it all at XRP.
&gt;&gt;2357158fuck sia, cashed out of that sinking boat with profit
&gt;&gt;2357102What happened? They didnt even present yet right?
HODLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rW6qGiWRC0
&gt;&gt;2357175It&#039;s currently at ATH and rising
&gt;&gt;2357212They presented and lost. Jared made prepared the presentation on Powerpoint 98 and put a sinking ship on it
PascalCoin will be the next DGBTake a look its already started
Get onto RDDRedd ID is coming soon.Will be 1K+ sats
&gt;&gt;2357231ATH is around 700 sat which I sold at.It&#039;ll never break 700 sat
&gt;&gt;2357221chicks tryna be guys
&gt;&gt;2357243Shhh the kind of people that shilled hard for DGB don&#039;t deserve to get on real coins.
&gt;&gt;2357102dumb question, espers of courseor xrp..you know, coins with future
&gt;&gt;2357102Whats the problem? DGB is worth as much as it was yesterday this time.
Ark obv.
&gt;&gt;2357396what makes rdd a real coin? I&#039;m already holding some, I can buy more
&gt;&gt;2357102SWT
&gt;&gt;2357102L I T E D O G EITEDOGE
&gt;&gt;2357510It&#039;s only going to go down from here. DGB tech isn&#039;t actually that good and holders put too much faith into some meme citibank competition for some reason. It&#039;ll never hit 2k sats ever again.
&gt;&gt;2357157&gt;&gt;2357243&gt;&gt;2357512So I bought RDD at 4 sats and sold a little later at 70 sats.Should I buy back, or not? I put some of it in BitBay (yea, whatever, but made a little profit) and DGB, but should I buy back in RDD?
Verge obviously.
Official laugh at DGB holders threadHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANANAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANANAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*inhales*HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANANAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Got in at 600 sats, never going to sell. Not even phased by the recent dip.
&gt;&gt;2357506Same. Bought at 500 and couldnt give a fuck. 300 SAT dip is nothing
HOLY FUCKING SHIT.DGB is not giving two shits about losing that competition. It&#039;s staying sturdy above 1900 sat which is pretty much yesterday&#039;s level.This is the toughest coin around. If you sell it, you&#039;ll fucking kill yourself out of shame when it reaches $1.
&gt;&gt;2357539&gt;there is at least one person ON THIS BOARD that are going to follow this bagholder&#039;s adviceJUST
The moon is our only destiny
I&#039;m seeing 3k next week or maybe even on sunday
Bought in @2245.I have about 6.7k.Not even that much money, even if it reaches $1.JUST
&gt;&gt;2357539where&#039;s the announcement that it lost?
&gt;&gt;2357616why&#039;s that?
&gt;&gt;2357506Bought in at 1900, Luckily I have iron hands and this coin has potential.
not holding enough to justify selling at these prices. Gonna wait for the moon, hodl boys, it all comes back
&gt;&gt;2357632I follow certain people on twitter who know thingshowever 3k was just a joke, 2500 quite likely
Got in at 200 and sold at 600. Just got back in.
Everybody knew this was coming if you sell at a loss you are retarded. I bought in early so this shit doesnt phase me. If i sold every time a coin dipped then no one here would make money.Y-you guys do know buy high sell low is a meme, r-right anons?
&gt;&gt;23576206.7k is a lot you dumb fuck
&gt;&gt;2357629https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoin/status/873129928010739713&gt; Congratulations to @iProov for winning today&#039;s #CitiT4IChallenge Some awesome facial recognition technology!
&gt;&gt;2357685If it reaches $1 i&#039;ll only have $6,700.Compared to the fucks that got in before it went to 200 sat.There was a guy that said he had 11 million DGB.fuck.
&gt;&gt;2357710Boo hoo, tough luck. Of course there&#039;s always someone better off than you. That doesn&#039;t mean that you should be looking at other guys&#039; fake portfolios and deciding your investments on their basis.
LMAO HAVE FUN HOLDING THOSE BAGSHAHAHAHHAH
Yeah it&#039;s shit, but who cares? Over here on yobit volume is picking up. It&#039;s been trading upwards to 3 sat last night, now it&#039;s back to 1 sat. You&#039;re literally printing money buying in at this price. 4 sat wall at only 1 BTC, but I would personally hold until 7-8 sats and drop when it gets noticed.
&gt;&gt;2357617Fuck off with your scam exchange
After the failure of b2 I&#039;m not messing with YOBIT pnds anymore
&gt;&gt;2357742Always buy at 1 sat my lad
&gt;&gt;2357772Well lesson learned at least
&gt;&gt;2357742I know what you are saying, lost 50% of my portfolio.
So I&#039;ve been waiting to jump into btc. Back when it was at 1200 or so a few weeks back, I kept waiting for 600 to buy in. Now I&#039;m waiting for another big dip. Was the 2600 the other day the big one? There seems to be resistance at 3,000 but support at 2700. WHICH WAY IS IT GOING TO GO
Buy now before it&#039;s too late.
Well if anyone would know which way the price will go that whole trading thing wouldn&#039;t really work would it?Grow some balls. Or wait till August 1st.
&gt;&gt;2356982Buy now. In five years, whether you bought at 2000 or 3000 won&#039;t matter that much, the important thing will be that you bought some.
just dollar cost average dumbass and buy in a little bit more during dips, you can&#039;t fail that way. You can&#039;t predict the market.
&gt;&gt;2357394I&#039;m going to go this route. Just waiting for another dip
&gt;&gt;2357383Yeah, but buying at almost half this price means double gains in future so it does matter
&gt;&gt;2356982I will wait till there is a serious dip.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#chartsLook at Jan 2014 when btc reached 1000$. Then it decreased for several years. I feel like the peak right now is similar to the peak in 2014.
toughts?the idea is great, but wordl isn&#039;t that simple, I don&#039;t think that big jews and corporations woudl like them to succes
&gt;&gt;2357817THE FUCK IS UP WITH YOUR ENGLISH
BUMP
&gt;&gt;2357875im a polack on benzos
Pssst.Hey.You haven&#039;t forgotten about me have you?15 sats. Not bad.
Its the next DGB.
Needs better memes.
&gt;&gt;2356770People just don&#039;t listen. They start buying espers around 100 sats.
ESP2 is basically what DGB was a year ago.Most of you got in after 500-1000 sat.This is 15 sat right now everyone.Take it or leave it.

&gt;&gt;2357408Are you retarded?He spent $722 on 27 BLK which is now worth $12k
&gt;&gt;2357408no, he turned $722 into $12k

Because I am a nocoiner who is waiting for the dip to get started into the crypto game. Don&#039;t get me wrong, my emotions are running high right now watching btc jump and skip as it is upwards, but I know that it will come back down, and settle out in a little bit, and I wish to buy the dip. I want to play with it though, and look at my investment over time while shifting it. I&#039;m feeling 25% to btc &amp; eth, %5 to XRP, ARK, XEM, STEEM, DASH, XVG, LDOGE, 1ST[40% in total],and the last10% in LTC. That being said, I know some of those coins are more dumb than others, but I see those in the risk % of things. From what i&#039;m reading it looks like fun to get into.tl;dr I want some of your BTC to see what I can turn it into!
&gt;&gt;2352029Literally wasted potential. Was into trig in 5th grade then got injured and life went downhill - picked up around 10th grade and I lost 100 lbs by starving myself as food was too expensive. Life is still shit and my injury is slowly killing me. I just want to drink red wine on an estate with my cat and maybe have a kidSomeone recently stole like $5000 worth of jewelry (probably all of our networth desu) from my mom that had been given to her by our father before he killed himself. Seeing her that distraught really killed me. I&#039;d love to be able to tell her to quit her job that she works at 6 days a week and that we&#039;re moving somewhere warm to relax without worrying about a mortgage anymore. Plus, if you actually sent me money and I made something out of it (I probably won&#039;t trade it, would rather hold it) I&#039;ll be sure to go through our transaction history and send you some back :).Also, I&#039;ve been following crypto since 13 years old... 20+ now and still only have .25 - I wanted to invest in it the first time I saw it on /b/ as a kid, but never had a computer of my own until maybe 19.If you&#039;re for real, thank you17FHjfUHm1TuNK3NkvAFt35LpLHaPuLke1
