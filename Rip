Given his relation to CSGO and the plethora of rumors surrounding this crash on Twitter and in the media, it should be noted that the rumors alleging that Rick Fox was also aboard the helicopter are reported to be false by his daughter and multiple other sources. Please do not spread this rumor as it detracts from the focus of this tragedy. Unfortunately, however, TMZ does report that his daughter Gianna Bryant was with Kobe in the helicopter and died alongside her father in the crash.
Wow had no idea he passed today. Rip Kobe. Man was a legend.
Yeah, it wasn't the most pleasant way to go either, apparently his kids may have died with him but everything is still unconfirmed Either way it's sad Edit: Apparently it's confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was with him on the helicopter, Rest in Peace to them both, that shit is so sad
From what ive seen on twitter its been confirmed one of his daughters was on the helicopter and Rick fox has also been confirmed to have not been involved in the crash. really wish people wouldnt just say shit on twitter / shitty online news articles for clicks.
TMZ confirmed his oldest daughter was on board. RIP. EDIT: Second oldest.
Not his oldest, he had a 17-year old. Gianna was his second daughter, she was 13.
damn
Didn't Rick Fox co-own Echo Fox or Misfits or NRG or something?
yeah echo fox because his son was super into league so he got into the esports side to connect with him
God imagine having so much money that you'd buy a gaming team to connect with your son.
Unfortunately, this is real. EDIT: TMZ: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376 Sources: Kobe Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna when the helicopter crashed. Those aboard the helicopter also included another player and parent.
No fucking way
I�ve never been in such shock over an athlete�s death, dude is an absolute icon and a legend already and is gone at such a young age
I'm in the same boat. I've never been a huge fan of basketball, but you hear these names over and over again and I have immense respect for them. My heart sunk when I saw the news.
I don't think I've even watched a full basketball game but I'm shocked and saddened, in that boat with you.
Exactly, and realizing he was only 12 years older than me. Only 12 fucking years. It's surreal, this is actually making me feel something and I never watch basketball.
I was just watching the Hoosiers game and heard breaking news. Saw Bryant's picture and my jaw dropped, only because he was at the game just the other night to congratulate James on passing him in points...
He wasn�t at the game but tweeted afterwards to congratulate James
Yeah...I went from furious to somber very quickly. Terrible news
I don't even watch Basketball. This is gut wrenching. My god
Let's try and keep the comments here civil. You don't have to like Kobe, but celebrating his death, making jokes about it, and wishing death/threatening other people still violates our rules. Users who threaten other people will be banned on sight.
I hope kids continue to say "Kobe" as they throw crumbled up pieces of paper into the trashcans.
I will never stop.
Every single day, around lunch time.
Any meal time
Any classroom
I just taught my two year old daughter to do that 3 days ago... :(
I say this literally every time I yeet throw a diaper into the trash with precision :(
Yeet for distance Kobe for accuracy
Yeet is when you just throw shit far as fuck. Kobe is when you accurately toss shit in the garbage
what the fuck. this is one of the most insane, out of left field headlines i�ve ever seen. RIP to an absolute legend
I've never felt this way about a celebrity death before. God damn
Felt the same thing about Roy Halladay. Just sick
First thing that came to mind for me too Roy was around the same age as Kobe too. Absolutely fucking heartbreaking
right about to get into the Hall
also a private aviation related accident
Halladay death was devastating but after the autopsy you can make sense of the situation. Not that it hurt any less, but this Kobe one feels different. So fucking tragic. ABC Report just did a news break during the Pro Bowl and the reporter said �It is believed to be that all four of his daughters were in the helicopter� Please not be the case
Its so weird that the death of a person I never met can affect my mood so much :/ This is just soooo depressing.
I haven't felt this way since Jose Fernandez died in that boat crash. It doesn't feel real.
Saddest I�ve ever been about a celebrity death. Gone too soon
I can't believe it dude. Kobe Bryant is dead. Fuck man. This is awful news.
I can't even believe it. This doesn't even feel possible. What the fuck.
Yeah my brain does not compute. Like everything points to it being a real story but I literally can't believe it.
I�m devastated, man. Just devastated.
I wasn't even a Lakers fan but this is just so so so so depressing. He's done so much for basketball. I feel so bad for his daughter and family in general, he was such a great dad :( Edit: Tmz just confirmed his daughter was on the helicopter as well. Fuck :(
I'm speechless wtf happened to my kobe
I�m completely shook right now. Grew up watching him.
at the gas pump and the woman next to me is balling bawling. This is awful. Edit: fixed it ya jerks lol. Fuck though.
It's what Kobe would want
Lol fuck you for making me laugh right now. Seriously though, thanks for this.
Actually for once a smart person being interviewed.
Judging from the title of this post, I thought I was going to get the "totally pitted" version of this story
For the uninitiated: https://youtu.be/Y5ckCAUVOn0
WA-PAH
Reminds me of Malibu
This is still one of my all time favorite videos. Dude has to be Steve-Os secret father.
To be fair he seems like an expert in his field
[deleted]
I think he's talking about the surfer bro here who seems to be an expert in broing out
i have never surfed before and i understood exactly what he was saying. he is talking about how the progresstion of the wave crash was very good for riding. he knows what he is talking about just doesnt realize his audience.
BIG W
A nice way to honor Kobe and make sure his name will always be relevant to the nba.
Kudos to Adam Silver for this Lebron playoff mode activated tomorrow to get the first Kobe Bryant trophy
I feel like Silver�s job is so easy. He plays us so well, gives us off-court things we want while adding on-court shit we hate.
Tbh that China thing was a nasty situation.
It was essentially a no win situation for him, he either follows his morals and costs his league and players millions, or he ruins the reputation of the league. Edit: to be clear, I am saying from the perspective of Adam silver it�s a no win situation. If he says no to China, his league loses millions in revenue and even more in potential profit. I�m not saying he was right to ignore morals and ethics, I�m just saying he can�t follow his morals without jeopardizing what�s more important to him which is money. And by doing that he messed up his leagues reputation of being �Woke� and �Socially conscious�.
No win situation Have morals Don't have morals Standing for what is right is hard. It has consequences, and costs. But that doesn't mean it should ever be considered a loss. Standing up for the oppressed is always a win, and anything you lose in the process should be worth it. Unfortunately, people don't really think that way much anymore. Edit: Ok, this has gotten a couple of golds now, so I just want to say to anyone else thinking of gilding it: please don't. On a post about how morally and ethically repugnant China is, giving money to this site when it's backed by a number of Chinese investment companies (Tencent notably) strikes me as wrong. If you really are desperate to throw 5 bucks away, please just consider donating it to a charity of your choice. Or, there are still a number of Honk Kong crowdfuning operations going on to help support those who have been injured during the protests, or their families if they have been killed. Or, just be a good person. Speak up when you see injustice. We could all stand to be better people who take more action in our day-to-day lives.
What sucks is the nba is a business, even if he wanted to say no to China all of his financial backers, partners and nba players would protest him for costing them millions.
Very true, lots of nuanced implications for everyone involved.
It's an American business. At least some of its values should be informed by the values of the American people. Things like freedom, liberty, justice... To just exclaim "Well, it's a business" doesn't absolve the businessman of moral responsibility. This bestial capitalism where every mean is justified by the bottom line end is something we can reject. We aren't slave to capital, and neither are the billionaires owning the NBA. They have a choice.
Please Lakers build a statue of him and Gigi outside of the Staples
That�s a given
Maybe playing basketball
Her sitting on his shoulders shooting the ball.
Kobe Blocking her cause he ain't backing down to anyone
Her trying to get him to flinch and he just stands there like a statue
Man.. one of the GOAT Kobe moments
My personal favorite Kobe moment of all time The birth of �mamba jaw� is up there too.
He didn�t believe in cutting people slack
still one of my favorite commercials. needed this laugh.
Please report any trolls to make it easier for us to spot things; there's a lot going on in this subreddit right now. Be wary of rumors. Thank you. Edit: Treat this as a megathread please. Some posts are being removed since there's such an influx right now. Thanks for understanding. Edit 2: Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation if anyone wants to take a look/give support to their foundation.
Horrible news, but thankfully he lived his life the way most people should strive to. Life can end at any moment, and he tried his hardest in any endeavor and made himself a legend. Of course people should be sad, but don't forget what he left behind for inspiration.
Tragic. Very sad to lose a legend so early in life. Kobe Bean was making huge strides in the entertainment industry as well. I really feel for his kids. He seemed like a great father. Horrible news.
at least he got his oscar, that seemed to be what meant most to him, so glad he got to accomplish it
Man that makes it even sadder, he was so young and still had so much more to give the world
I actually disagree, he had so much more to give, but at least he got a chance to show people that, and ultimately, Kobe got to accomplish his dream of winning an oscar and giving back to the game of basketball, he had so much more to do, but the small bit he did do will without a doubt be remembered forever
My dad said the same sentiment, that he had a great life.
I�m a grown ass man crying today for a dude I�ve never met. That�s the impact Kobe had on everyone. Mamba forever
Me too man. To be fair, I probably cry more than most men. But I can't ever remember being impacted by a celebrity death like this. Closest I'd ever gotten to tears was Carrie Fisher, but I don't think that really made me cry. Part of me wants to watch Mamba highlights right now, but I just know that'll make me sadder. This sucks. Prayers for Kobe's family.
Can't find any secondary sources, but TMZ is usually legit. I really hope it's fake.
Took me a couple reads to understand what's actually going on but it's interesting to say the least
Can you explain? So the resets in the 2nd quarter and again in the 3rd quarter? So what's the point of the first half.
For Example: Before the game - East picks Charity A, West Picks Charity B Quarter 1 - 12 minute quarter East - 32, West - 28 (Charity A gets $100,000) Quarter 2 - 12 minute quarter East - 36, West - 36 (Money rolls to next Quarter's winner) Quarter 3 - 12 minute quarter East 35, West 33 (Charity A gets $100,000 from Quarter 2, and $100,000 from Quarter 3) Quarter 4 - Untimed Quarter East Leads 103-97 First Team to reach the score of 127 (32+36+35+24) wins $200,000 for their charity. If it's East, since they've won the other three quarters already, both charities instead split the final $200,000 Charity B also wins $100,000.
What on Earth were they thinking...
That this would be an intriguing was to add suspense to the game and make the end more dramatic. Watching the west try to come back while the east is on game point is way better than watching them Chuck 3s for the last two minutes waiting for the clock to run out.
watching them Chuck 3s for the last two minutes waiting for the clock to run out i don't really mind this new idea but the end of the game is usually somewhat competitive already
Right, and now they're trying to make the ends of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters nearly as exciting.
It probably makes it more fun for the players as well? They can rotate who gets to finish out each quarter.
Yea they usually fuck around until five minutes in the fourth quarter
Yup, which I'm honestly fine with. I can worry less about guys getting hurt, and also people forget that the lazy defense in the 1st half of these games is why we get all of those amazing highlight dunks. So yeah: fuck around for most of the game, play hard at the end.
