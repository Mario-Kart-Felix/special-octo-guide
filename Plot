        As a general rule, you should only talk about cars getting hacked if you've hacked a car, see for example:http://www.wpxi.com/news/investigates/11-investigates-could-a-self-driving-uber-be-targeted-by-hackers/462499562 ... 
        In our 2016 paper, we showed control of steering, braking, acceleration - systems in cars are already all connected.
        Also, he says at least you could pull emergency brake, in same paper we talk about engaging/making sure emergency brake can't be engaged
        Emergency brake in many cars is controlled by a computer already as we showed in our paper...

        There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too.
        Here's what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial, about to face cold turkey.
        Take Care of the People, and God Almighty Will Take Care of Himself.

        To kill Castro, the CIA finally turned to the world's most relentless killer: 2016.
        At this point, wouldn't we liberals prefer Evan McMullin to Donald Trump? If electors go rogue, this outcome is one possibility.

        If you want a Marxist to look up to, go with Salvador Allende. Castro, while an interesting guy, was a prize asshole
        Allende: elected, committed democrat, victim of CIA conspiracy, martyr to the cause. If he looked like Che his face would be on everything
        The death of Castro is one of those treasured moments when I can be annoyed by all sides of a question at once
        Think of how much further along we would be if Castro's beard had been used for Unix instead of dictatoring
        What sucks about living under Cuban-style socialism isn't just oppression and poverty, but the massive sense of wasted time, wasted talent
        I've heard of socialism described as the DMV running your society, but my last few experiences at the California DMV were way better
        Visit Cuba today and you'll see people waiting for hours for transport, just because someone got an ideological boner back in the fifties
        @Pinboard thank you, but i can do this right here, in new york city. fucking robert moses.
        @Pinboard Do you really think it'd be better otherwise? Cuba better off than Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala. Waste far more criminal there.

        In most states, voting systems are paid for and run by counties. Budget comes out of same pot that funds, e.g., the fire dept, roads, etc.
        2002's "Help America Vote Act" provided federal funding for new voting tech. But that was a one time deal.
        The technical problems with voting systems are complex and daunting. So are the political and operational environments they operate in.
        So, again, if your answer here is, "it's simple! All you have to do is... ", stop.
        Someone clearly had an intel briefing this morning...https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802499192237080576 ... 
        Even the "simple" solution (paper ballots) isn't simple. How are the ballots read? Where does the $$ come from to buy the scanners? etc.
        Basically, you'll have to sell your "simple" voting tech solution by explaining to voters why it's worth closing a firehouse to get.
        I used to live a couple blocks from a Cuban restaurant. I think that qualifies me as an expert on the implications of Castro's death.
        I should clarify that I never actually ate there, but I did read their takeout menu fairly carefully. I'm that kind of foreign policy wonk.
        At least I think it was a Cuban restaurant.
        Others will feel differently, but if a loved one were murdered, I think executing the murderer would worsen my pain.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/death-penalty-dylann-roof-charleston.html ...
